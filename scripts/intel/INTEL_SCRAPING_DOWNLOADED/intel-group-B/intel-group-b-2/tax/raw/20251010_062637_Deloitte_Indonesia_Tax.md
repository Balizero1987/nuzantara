Tax Transformation

Business model evolution is accelerating more quickly than ever. Take the first step towards transforming your tax department to increase your team’s agility and position your tax function as dynamic, fluid and influential.

Sustainability & Climate

Today’s climate crisis is spurring organisations to focus on sustainability expectations. As with any business transformation, there can be tax consequences as a result of business model and supply chain changes. We can work with you, not only to help you to take action, but to accelerate your journey to net-zero.

Pillar Two

Tax reform at this scale changes many aspects of how global businesses are taxed—and in turn, their data requirements, calculation and reporting demands. We can help you to identify and assess the impact of this complex and new legislation in multiple countries.

Generative AI

Here, we provide insights, resources on developments in GenAI for tax compliance, strategy and forecasting and examples of how Deloitte is working with our clients and alliances parties to unlock its potential to develop the future of tax, now.

Intela

Intela is the global platform that powers your tax experience with Deloitte. By combining AI and cloud computing technologies, Intela can help to unite information, processes, teams and automate workflows while also providing customised-for-you views of Deloitte knowledge on tax developments and industry trends.

Policy

Tax policy is at the forefront of the global agenda, driving dialogue among governments, businesses and societies as they tackle the challenges and seize the opportunities of the 21st century. From addressing climate change and sustainability to navigating digital transformation and the complexities of cross-border remote work, Pillar Two and tax transparency and reporting, tax policy is emerging as a pivotal force shaping the future of our economies and societies.
