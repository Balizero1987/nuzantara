Steadyhairdo is an old expat aussie who doesn't do his own shopping. He doesn't have a clue! For instance you can check on the pertamina website for fuel price and its always around 14,000 Rp

I own a small restaurant with my local wife. We buy Bintang bottle for 450k per 24 and sell for 55k.

Vegetables are increasing because of tourists, there's nothing we can do about that.

Maybe you should only speak about things you know so as to not misinform people, thank you.
Scammed bule on Jun 11, 2024:
To the previous commenter 'Steadyhairdo'.

These prices are what you all sell your stuff to foreigners. This page is to inform foreigners what the cost of living is in Bali.
If you get it cheaper as a local, congratulations for the racism and dual pricing, which would be illegal in normal parts of the world.
Steadyhairdo on May 26, 2024:
Here is another joke page. My 2nd home is Bali and all the prices listed here are ''Tourist'' values.
No local is paying anything close to what is listed here.
Local beer, a Bintang is 15,000Rp @ most local warung's ($1.50 aussie)
Locals don't smoke Marlboro, their local brands are roughly 8000Rp
1.5L water?? 12,400Rp?? I never pay more than 2000Rp
Fuel??? 13,850Rp a litre?? Someone is having a total lend here.
Bananas?? 25,000Rp a kilo?? Are these wrapped in Gold leaf??
Almost all the listed prices here are Airport or 5XXXXX Hotel Resort prices, not close to 'Local' prices at all.

Such is Life on Jul 01, 2023:
Living on Bali 10+ years and I'd tend to agree - for better or for worse - with the data in general as well as most comments posted thus far. The truth is that Bali is whatever you need it to be, which offers a person a unique type of individual freedom. It can be very affordable or extremely expensive, it can be frustrating or you can accept it and learn and grow from it. Ultimately it's a lifestyle choice with many, many possibilities. I'd submit it's an island with one of the best quality of life to cost ratios in the world, but the real Bali will only reveal itself to you in time.
YELNA YURISTIARY on Apr 29, 2023:
You can living within IDR 3 million. Consider 1 million for rent room, 1.5 million for food (if you eat in local food - not in foreigner restaurant) and 500k for fuel using motorbike or walking. Please cook your own food at home if you want to spend cheaper cost. It will be healthier and practical. I just read some comment in this section, honestly I think that person is not really see the beauty of Bali. You are what you're looking for. I had been in Europe, Africa, Southeast Asian country and I can say Bali is the best places to living. I ever be in popular cities in Europe and in the tourist place you will be aware with a lot of pick pocket and gangster. In Bali, I think it's quite difficult to find pick pocket because they will punished the people who do vandalism or criminal in their places. So, whoever told that Bali has a lot of scammers, maybe he ever got heart broken by Balinese girl. Lol...

wow! can’t wait to eat dogs in bali!!
Bali bae on Jan 24, 2023:
I'm from NY and living in bali has been the best decision I've ever made. Just be nice to locals and they'll treat you the same way you treat them. Some tourist have no respect towards balinese or locals, just behave if you want locals to respect you. The food is god-tier and the best part is it costs less than $20 bucks to experience heavenly cuisine.
Anonymous on Jan 24, 2023:
Hi, I love bali!! Living cost is much cheaper than other countries. Locals are very nice to tourist. I don't know what these people are ranting about bali, for me it has been a pleasant experience. You can literally eat starting from $1.
BaliSuxAss on Jul 11, 2022:
Yep. Guy below me is right. It's a shithole
Anonymous on Aug 16, 2021:
It's a scummy place with A LOT of dishonest people. Lazy, stupid and full of themselves, pretending to be nice to you just to scam as much money out of anyone possible. It's corrupt in every level, so don't expect any justice to be found.

Overall it's filled with cowards who always gang up on anyone who dares to point out any issue. Because they are too big of a scum themselves to ever make anything difference. Low conscious people, attracting similar tourists as well.

A single person would need a minimum of 16,000,000 each month to live decently in Bali.

How much money in IDR for food would a Balinese person need to live on per month
Just food not rent.
