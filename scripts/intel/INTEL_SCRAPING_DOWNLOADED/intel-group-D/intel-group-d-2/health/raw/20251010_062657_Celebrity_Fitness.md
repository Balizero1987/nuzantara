WHAT MEMBERS THINK ABOUT US

David

I trained with a Personal Trainer to help me stay consistent with my workouts and enjoy every bit of progress. After joining the Journey to Stardom program, I managed to lose 9kg, all thanks to the support of my Personal Trainer.

“SMASH YOUR WAY TO THE TOP”

I realized that if I did not make a lifestyle change immediately, I might never do it and get worse. I gave myself one year to find that person inside me who was screaming to get out. That was when I met Amirul. I told him I wanted my sexy back! And that was the start of my journey.

Aswaniza • Feb 2018

“BURN FOR A LEANER BODY”

I had a very sedentary lifestyle due to my work, and food was my comfort. At the end of 2017, I had gained 5kg in 3 months and was out of shape with a high BMI and low stamina.

So I decided to take charge of my health. I signed up for personal training sessions at Celebrity Fitness to kickstart my fitness goals.

Ferdinand Maluntad

Through the fitness journey, I learnt that I am capable of so much more than I thought possible. I gained confidence to participate in the Spartan Race (Super) last year as well as going for circuit classes such as Athletica and Primal, exclusively available at Fitness First Sports Performance. I am currently taking up my Masters in Business Administration (MBA) while balancing time for family, work, fitness and studies.
