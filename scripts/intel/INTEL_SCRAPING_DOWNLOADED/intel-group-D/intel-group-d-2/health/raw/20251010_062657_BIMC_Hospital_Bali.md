What they say

Heb 9 dagen in BIMC gelegen en ben heel goed verzorgd en geweldig geholpen. Voor de Dermatoloog en de Neuroloog hebben een heel goede diagnose gesteld wat in Nederland in 5 maanden niet lukte was bij Dokter Lakmi met 7 dagen een beter resultaat dan in Nederland. Met heel veel dank daarvoor.

Heb in december 9 dagen in het ziekenhuis gelegen tot volle tevredenheid. Hen een neuroloog aan mijn bed gehad die gek de goede diagnoses stelde, een geweldige dame. Veel dank aan haar. En ook een Dermatoloog ook ern dame, wat in 5 maanden in Nederland niet lukte om de psoriasis te verminderen lukte dokter Lakmi binnen 1 week geweldig en ben ontzettend dankbaar dat ik weer gewoon een zonnenjurk aan kan.

Today back for the follow up check after the herkende from the hospital. Again the staff and nurses were very friendly and helpful. Everything was on schedule. The pulmonologist dr Made Nian Anggara did the test and gave us clear and adequate information and explanation. I think she is really a roll model for the medical profession. Thank you for your help and support.

I have had the best care during my stay. The nursing staff are very attentive, the doctors are available and the room is very comfortable. It’s scary having surgery in another country, but I was reassured and felt very safe the whole time. I am so relieved that our travel insurance covered my treatment, and that it was an easy process to get the bill paid in advance.

Excellent care treating a minor infected burn I incurred before arriving in Bali. Great care was taken that the antibiotics prescribed had minimal interaction with Warfarin. Instructions to dress the wound subsequently were very detailed plus bandaging, gauze and anti-bacterial netting were provided. First class!
