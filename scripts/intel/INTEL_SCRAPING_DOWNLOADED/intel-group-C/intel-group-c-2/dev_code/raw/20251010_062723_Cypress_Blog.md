cy.prompt() vs. MCP agents: AI Designed for Real World Testing, Not Just Tasks
Education: Cypress AI
AI is already reshaping how teams approach end-to-end testing, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) agents have quickly become a popular way to let large language models drive browsers using MCP servers. Many of you have asked if Cypress will release an MCP server of our own. Our approach to AI is centered on Cypress' philosophy of making testing easier. That’s why we’re building cy.prompt, a specialized command designed to help teams write and maintain reliable tests. Both MCP agents and cy.prompt

Cypress 15 Made Simple: Upgrade Paths from 13 and 14

Upgrading your test suite to a new major version can feel daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. Cypress 15 continues the work started in 14 by moving support toward modern frameworks and current versions of Node.js, while phasing out older dependencies. Alongside these changes, the release ships with an updated Electron/Chromium engine that improves stability and speed across test runs. Cypress 15 also ships an updated test authoring experience, with Cypress Studio. It now supports inline editin

How to test the new ARIA Notify API with Cypress

The ARIA Notify API is a new way to communicate live page updates to assistive technology like screen readers. This helps make interactive web applications more accessible and solves some problems with current workarounds. It currently has experimental status, but can be used with a polyfill to help provide a similar experience in situations where it is not yet supported. In this blog post we'll explain what this new API does and how to test it using Cypress. We'll also end up covering other Cy

More keys, more power: cy.press() got an upgrade in Cypress 15.1.0

When we first introduced cy.press() in Cypress 14.3.0, it unlocked something our community had been asking for: a way to send real, native keyboard events to the browser. The initial release focused on one of the most important keys for accessibility testing: Tab, so you could confidently verify focus management and keyboard navigation. With Cypress 15.1.0, we've expanded support far beyond Tab. You can now use cy.press() to simulate letters, numbers, special characters, and a wide range of nam

"In-test" vs "out-of-test" accessibility automation

Since we've opened up free trials of Cypress Accessibility in Cypress Cloud, one question we've been answering is: how is this different to just running accessibility checks using an open source package like cypress-axe? At a high level, the approach taken in Cypress Accessibility helps teams stop dealing with some of the slower and more manual aspects of collecting, triaging, and communicating about accessibility problems, so they get back to focusing on their primary tasks faster.

Cypress Cloud Journey: From 1-Hour Nightmares to 7-Minute Dreams

Hi, I’m S Chathuranga Jayasinghe. I’m currently an SDET at Riverty, but during my time at Trackman I had the opportunity to rethink how we approached test automation. What started as hour-long test runs and painful debugging journeys eventually turned into a fast, reliable, and scalable workflow powered by Cypress Cloud. I’ve spent over 10 years in quality engineering, focusing on automation frameworks, CI/CD integration, and helping teams transition from legacy test setups into modern, maintai

Cypress 15: The foundation for what’s next

Cypress 15 is here, and while this release might look mostly foundational on the surface, it’s setting us up for something much bigger. We’ve made changes across the board to improve stability, clear out legacy support, and upgrade core parts of the platform. But the big story is this: Cypress Studio is evolving. A new era for Cypress Studio If you've used Cypress Studio before, you know the promise. You can click through your app and record tests automatically. In Cypress 15, we’ve taken tha
