We help people push past the status quo toward meaningful progress

The Clayton Christensen Institute enables leaders to radically improve entire sectors through rigorous research and community empowerment. Using Disruptive Innovation and other theories developed by Harvard Business School Professor Clayton Christensen, we develop a clearer understanding of how the world works so we can create purposeful progress in our world. Where traditional solutions to seemingly intractable challenges fall short, teaching theories and conducting applied research can bridge chasms between current realities and societal progress.

What People Are Saying
Without Disruptive Innovation Theory or Jobs to Be Done Theory, we’d continue with the status quo. And now that I know the thought process, I don’t want to go back. If others had a better understanding of the way the world works, they could focus on the things that mattered the most without going down the wrong path.
Biagio Arobba
Rosebud Sioux Tribal Member and freelance software engineer
As somebody that works and travels a lot, I need information in quick bites: easy-to-read pieces from trusted people. ‘Trusted people’ doesn’t mean I necessarily agree with them. Trusted people are those who really know the market and are going to challenge me.
Kristin Greene

I am fortunate to know a number of the Institute’s researchers, as well as other staff. I know that they’re not only excellent researchers and thought leaders committed to Clay’s legacy, they’re great people as well. These theories are far more than tools to create better managers—they have the potential to make the world a better place.
