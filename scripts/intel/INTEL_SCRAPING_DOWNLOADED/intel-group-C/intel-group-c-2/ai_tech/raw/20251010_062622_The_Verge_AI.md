Artificial intelligence is more a part of our lives than ever before. While some might call it hype and compare it to NFTs or 3D TVs, generative AI is causing a sea change in nearly every part of the technology industry. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is still the best-known AI chatbot around, but with Google pushing Gemini, Microsoft building Copilot, and Apple adding its Intelligence to Siri, AI is probably going to be in the spotlight for a very long time. At The Verge, we’re exploring what might be possible with AI — and a lot of the bad stuff AI does, too.

George Miller says ‘AI is here to stay.’

In an interview with The Guardian, the Mad Max director described generative AI as “arguably the most dynamically evolving tool in making moving image,” and that art has to evolve. “It will make screen storytelling available to anyone who has a calling to it,” he says. “It’s way more egalitarian.”

Countries are spending billions on “sovereign AI” efforts.

Given how fast the frontier is moving, why bother? Tzu Kit Chan, an AI strategist who advises the Malaysian government, told The Guardian countries would be better off beefing up regulations than making tech to compete with US giants.

“Go to Kuala Lumpur, find a finance-bro-looking-person, ask them what model they’re using. Eight out of 10, I bet they’re not using the sovereign AI models. They’re saying, ChatGPT or Gemini.”

Governments are spending billions on their own ‘sovereign’ AI technologies – is it a big waste of money?

AI legal risks are proving uninsurable.

Ballooning liabilities have underwriters avoiding AI giants like OpenAI and Anthropic, the Financial Times reports. They’re spooked by the sheer volume of claims for things like wrongful death and copyright infringement, as well as enormous judgments against them. Investor funds are reportedly being considered to settle claims.

A busy week for OpenAI’s social video machine.

Analytics firm Appfigures told The Verge Sora was downloaded 627,000 times in its first week on Apple’s App Store. Sora is still invite-only, so it’s hard to tell how many people are actually using it, but its first week has been plagued with controversy after users generated a torrent of AI slop, deepfakes, and disturbing copyright violations.

OpenAI’s head of ChatGPT said it will significantly evolve in the next six months.

During a Q&A with reporters at DevDay, Nick Turley referenced one of the event’s earlier announcements — that OpenAI is introducing a way to work with apps like Canva, Zillow, Coursera, and Spotify inside ChatGPT — and the chatbot’s next stage of growth. “What you’re going to see for the next six months is an evolution of ChatGPT from an app that is really, really useful into something that feels a little bit more like an operating system.” Within ChatGPT, he said, people will be able to access services and software — both existing software they’re used to using and new software built “natively” atop ChatGPT.

OpenAI will eventually allow “mature” ChatGPT apps.

When creating apps for ChatGPT, developers must follow a set of guidelines that say apps must be appropriate for everyone, including people aged 13 to 17. However, OpenAI notes that it will support mature (18+) apps once it implements the “appropriate age verification and controls.”

The San Francisco event will kick off with a keynote by CEO Sam Altman, followed by a media Q&A with OpenAI executives like Greg Brockman and Brad Lightcap, a developer state of the union, and a closing fireside chat between Altman and famed former Apple designer Jony Ive.

No word yet on exactly what will be announced, but we may hear updates about the buzzy AI device OpenAI is building with Ive and his team, as well as how OpenAI could change Sora, its new social media app for AI-generated video.

There are a lot of reasons to be cautious about generative AI tools like OpenAI’s Sora — environmental, ethical, financial, and more — but let’s not forget the fact that it can also be really, really annoying.
