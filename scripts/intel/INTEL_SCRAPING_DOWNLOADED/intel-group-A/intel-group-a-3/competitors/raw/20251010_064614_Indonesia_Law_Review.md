Indonesia Law Review (ILREV) is an open access, double-blind peer-reviewed law journal. It was first published by the Djokosoetono Research Center (DRC) in 2011 to address the lack of scholarly literatures on Indonesian law accessible in English for an international audience.

ILREV focuses on recent developments of legal scholarship, covering legal reform and development, contemporary societal issues, as well as institutional change in Indonesia.

Realizing the global challenges and ever-increasing legal interaction among developing countries, ILREV also welcomes articles on legal development in the ASEAN region and the larger Global South.

By that token, it aims to provide a platform for academic dialogue and exchanges of ideas between scholars and professionals, especially from the Global South. As such, ILREV encourages comparative, multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and other approaches to law which can enrich the development of legal scholarship not only in Indonesia but also the Global South as a whole.

Indonesia Law Review is Nationally Accredited (Accreditation Rank II) by the Minister of Research and Technology/National Research and Innovation Agency of the Republic of Indonesia Decision No. 148/M/KPT/2020 on The Accreditation Rank of Scientific Journals Period II of 2020.

See the Focus and Scope for a complete coverage of the journal.
