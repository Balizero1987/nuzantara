JAX v0.7.2 Latest

Breaking changes:

jax.dlpack.from_dlpack no longer accepts a DLPack capsule. This
behavior was deprecated and is now removed. The function must be called
with an array implementing __dlpack__ and __dlpack_device__.

Changes

The minimum supported NumPy version is now 2.0. Since SciPy 1.13 is required
for NumPy 2.0 support, the minimum supported SciPy version is now 1.13.

JAX now represents constants in its internal jaxpr representation as a
LiteralArray, which is a private JAX type that duck types as a
numpy.ndarray. This type may be exposed to users via custom_jvp rules,
for example, and may break code that uses isinstance(x, np.ndarray). If
this breaks your code, you may convert these arrays to classic NumPy arrays
using np.asarray(x).

Bug fixes

arr.view(dtype=None) now returns the array unchanged, matching NumPy's
semantics. Previously it returned the array with a float dtype.
jax.random.randint now produces a less-biased distribution for 8-bit and
16-bit integer types ({jax-issue}#27742). To restore the previous biased
behavior, you may temporarily set the jax_safer_randint configuration to
False, but note this is a temporary config that will be removed in a
future release.

Deprecations:

The parameters enable_xla and native_serialization for jax2tf.convert
are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of JAX. These were
used for jax2tf with non-native serialization, which has been now removed.
Setting the config state jax_pmap_no_rank_reduction to False is
deprecated. By default, jax_pmap_no_rank_reduction will be set to True
and jax.pmap shards will not have their rank reduced, keeping the same
rank as their enclosing array.

JAX v0.7.1

New features

JAX now ships Python 3.14 and 3.14t wheels.
JAX now ships Python 3.13t and 3.14t wheels on Mac. Previously we only
offered free-threading builds on Linux.

Changes

Exposed jax.set_mesh which acts as a global setter and a context manager.
Removed jax.sharding.use_mesh in favor of jax.set_mesh.
JAX is now built using CUDA 12.9. All versions of CUDA 12.1 or newer remain
supported.
jax.lax.dot now implements the general dot product via the optional
dimension_numbers argument.

Deprecations:

jax.lax.zeros_like_array is deprecated. Please use
jax.numpy.zeros_like instead.
Attempting to import jax.experimental.host_callback now results in
a DeprecationWarning, and will result in an ImportError starting in JAX
v0.8.0. Its APIs have raised NotImplementedError since JAX version 0.4.35.
In jax.lax.dot, passing the precision and preferred_element_type
arguments by position is deprecated. Pass them by explicit keyword instead.
Several dozen internal APIs have been deprecated from jax.interpreters.ad,
jax.interpreters.batching, and jax.interpreters.partial_eval; they
are used rarely if ever outside JAX itself, and most are deprecated without any
public replacement.

Compare
JAX v0.7.0

New features:

Added jax.P which is an alias for jax.sharding.PartitionSpec.
Added jax.tree.reduce_associative.

Breaking changes:

JAX is migrating from GSPMD to Shardy by default. See the
migration guide
for more information.
JAX autodiff is switching to using direct linearization by default (instead of
implementing linearization via JVP and partial eval).
See migration guide
for more information.
jax.stages.OutInfo has been replaced with jax.ShapeDtypeStruct.
jax.jit now requires fun to be passed by position, and additional
arguments to be passed by keyword. Doing otherwise will result in an error
starting in v0.7.x. This raised a DeprecationWarning in v0.6.x.
The minimum Python version is now 3.11. 3.11 will remain the minimum
supported version until July 2026.
Layout API renames:
Layout, .layout, .input_layouts and .output_layouts have been
renamed to Format, .format, .input_formats and .output_formats
DeviceLocalLayout, .device_local_layout have been renamed to Layout
and .layout
jax.experimental.shard module has been deleted and all the APIs have been
moved to the jax.sharding endpoint. So use jax.sharding.reshard,
jax.sharding.auto_axes and jax.sharding.explicit_axes instead of their
experimental endpoints.
lax.infeed and lax.outfeed were removed, after being deprecated in
JAX 0.6. The transfer_to_infeed and transfer_from_outfeed methods were
also removed the Device objects.
The jax.extend.core.primitives.pjit_p primitive has been renamed to
jit_p, and its name attribute has changed from "pjit" to "jit".
This affects the string representations of jaxprs. The same primitive is no
longer exported from the jax.experimental.pjit module.
The (undocumented) function jax.extend.backend.add_clear_backends_callback
has been removed. Users should use jax.extend.backend.register_backend_cache
instead.

Deprecations:

{obj}jax.dlpack.SUPPORTED_DTYPES is deprecated; please use the new
jax.dlpack.is_supported_dtype function.
jax.scipy.special.sph_harm has been deprecated following a similar
deprecation in SciPy; use jax.scipy.special.sph_harm_y instead.
From {mod}jax.interpreters.xla, the previously deprecated symbols
abstractify and pytype_aval_mappings have been removed.
jax.interpreters.xla.canonicalize_dtype is deprecated. For
canonicalizing dtypes, prefer jax.dtypes.canonicalize_dtype.
For checking whether an object is a valid jax input, prefer
jax.core.valid_jaxtype.
From {mod}jax.core, the previously deprecated symbols AxisName,
ConcretizationTypeError, axis_frame, call_p, closed_call_p,
get_type, trace_state_clean, typematch, and typecheck have been
removed.
From {mod}jax.lib.xla_client, the previously deprecated symbols
DeviceAssignment, get_topology_for_devices, and mlir_api_version
have been removed.
jax.extend.ffi was removed after being deprecated in v0.5.0.
Use {mod}jax.ffi instead.
jax.lib.xla_bridge.get_compile_options is deprecated, and replaced by
jax.extend.backend.get_compile_options.

New features:

Added jax.lax.axis_size which returns the size of the mapped axis
given its name.

Changes

Additional checking for the versions of CUDA package dependencies was
reenabled, having been accidentally disabled in a previous release.
JAX nightly packages are now published to artifact registry. To install
these packages, see the JAX installation guide.
jax.sharding.PartitionSpec no longer inherits from a tuple.
jax.ShapeDtypeStruct is immutable now. Please use .update method to
update your ShapeDtypeStruct instead of doing in-place updates.

JAX v0.6.0

Breaking changes

jax.numpy.array no longer accepts None. This behavior was
deprecated since November 2023 and is now removed.
Removed the config.jax_data_dependent_tracing_fallback config option,
which was added temporarily in v0.4.36 to allow users to opt out of the
new "stackless" tracing machinery.
Removed the config.jax_eager_pmap config option.
Disallow the calling of lower and trace AOT APIs on the result
of jax.jit if there have been subsequent wrappers applied.
Previously this worked, but silently ignored the wrappers.
The workaround is to apply jax.jit last among the wrappers,
and similarly for jax.pmap.
See #27873.
The cuda12_pip extra for jax has been removed; use pip install jax[cuda12]
instead.

Changes

The minimum CuDNN version is v9.8.
JAX is now built using CUDA 12.8. All versions of CUDA 12.1 or newer remain
supported.
JAX package extras are now updated to use dash instead of underscore to
align with PEP 685. For instance, if you were previously using pip install jax[cuda12_local]
to install JAX, run pip install jax[cuda12-local] instead.
jax.jit now requires fun to be passed by position, and additional
arguments to be passed by keyword. Doing otherwise will result in a
DeprecationWarning in v0.6.X, and an error in starting in v0.7.X.

Deprecations

jax.tree_util.build_tree is deprecated. Use jax.tree.unflatten
instead.
Implemented host callback handlers for CPU and GPU devices using XLA's FFI
and removed existing CPU/GPU handlers using XLA's custom call.
All APIs in jax.lib.xla_extension are now deprecated.
jax.interpreters.mlir.hlo and jax.interpreters.mlir.func_dialect,
which were accidental exports, have been removed. If needed, they are
available from jax.extend.mlir.
jax.interpreters.mlir.custom_call is deprecated. The APIs provided by
jax.ffi should be used instead.
The deprecated use of jax.ffi.ffi_call with inline arguments is no
longer supported. jax.ffi.ffi_call now unconditionally returns a
callable.
The following exports in jax.lib.xla_client are deprecated:
get_topology_for_devices, heap_profile, mlir_api_version, Client,
CompileOptions, DeviceAssignment, Frame, HloSharding, OpSharding,
Traceback.
The following internal APIs in jax.util are deprecated:
HashableFunction, as_hashable_function, cache, safe_map, safe_zip,
split_dict, split_list, split_list_checked, split_merge, subvals,
toposort, unzip2, wrap_name, and wraps.
jax.dlpack.to_dlpack has been deprecated. You can usually pass a JAX
Array directly to the from_dlpack function of another framework. If you
need the functionality of to_dlpack, use the __dlpack__ attribute of an
array.
jax.lax.infeed, jax.lax.infeed_p, jax.lax.outfeed, and
jax.lax.outfeed_p are deprecated and will be removed in JAX v0.7.0.
Several previously-deprecated APIs have been removed, including:
From jax.lib.xla_client: ArrayImpl, FftType, PaddingType,
PrimitiveType, XlaBuilder, dtype_to_etype,
ops, register_custom_call_target, shape_from_pyval, Shape,
XlaComputation.
From jax.lib.xla_extension: ArrayImpl, XlaRuntimeError.
From jax: jax.treedef_is_leaf, jax.tree_flatten, jax.tree_map,
jax.tree_leaves, jax.tree_structure, jax.tree_transpose, and
jax.tree_unflatten. Replacements can be found in jax.tree or
jax.tree_util.
From jax.core: AxisSize, ClosedJaxpr, EvalTrace, InDBIdx, InputType,
Jaxpr, JaxprEqn, Literal, MapPrimitive, OpaqueTraceState, OutDBIdx,
Primitive, Token, TRACER_LEAK_DEBUGGER_WARNING, Var, concrete_aval,
dedup_referents, escaped_tracer_error, extend_axis_env_nd, full_lower, get_referent, jaxpr_as_fun, join_effects, lattice_join,
leaked_tracer_error, maybe_find_leaked_tracers, raise_to_shaped,
raise_to_shaped_mappings, reset_trace_state, str_eqn_compact,
substitute_vars_in_output_ty, typecompat, and used_axis_names_jaxpr. Most
have no public replacement, though a few are available at jax.extend.core.
The vectorized argument to jax.pure_callback and
jax.ffi.ffi_call. Use the vmap_method parameter instead.

JAX v0.5.3

New Features

Added a allow_negative_indices option to jax.lax.dynamic_slice,
jax.lax.dynamic_update_slice and related functions. The default is
true, matching the current behavior. If set to false, JAX does not need to
emit code clamping negative indices, which improves code size.
Added a replace option to jax.random.categorical to enable sampling
without replacement.

JAX v0.5.1

New Features

Added an experimental jax.experimental.custom_dce.custom_dce
decorator to support customizing the behavior of opaque functions under
JAX-level dead code elimination (DCE). See #25956 for more
details.
Added low-level reduction APIs in {mod}jax.lax: jax.lax.reduce_sum,
jax.lax.reduce_prod, jax.lax.reduce_max, jax.lax.reduce_min,
jax.lax.reduce_and, jax.lax.reduce_or, and jax.lax.reduce_xor.
jax.lax.linalg.qr, and jax.scipy.linalg.qr, now support
column-pivoting on CPU and GPU. See #20282 and
#25955 for more details.

Changes

JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION and JAX_NUM_CPU_DEVICES now work as
env vars. Before they could only be specified via jax.config or flags.
JAX_CPU_COLLECTIVES_IMPLEMENTATION now defaults to 'gloo', meaning
multi-process CPU communication works out-of-the-box.
The jax[tpu] TPU extra no longer depends on the libtpu-nightly package.
This package may safely be removed if it is present on your machine; JAX now
uses libtpu instead.

Deprecations

The internal function linear_util.wrap_init and the constructor
core.Jaxpr now must take a non-empty core.DebugInfo kwarg. For
a limited time, a DeprecationWarning is printed if
jax.extend.linear_util.wrap_init is used without debugging info.
A downstream effect of this several other internal functions need debug
info. This change does not affect public APIs.
See #26480 for more detail.

Bug fixes

TPU runtime startup and shutdown time should be significantly improved on
TPU v5e and newer (from around 17s to around 8s). If not already set, you may
need to enable transparent hugepages in your VM image
(sudo sh -c 'echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled').
We hope to improve this further in future releases.
Persistent compilation cache no longer writes access time file if
JAX_COMPILATION_CACHE_MAX_SIZE is unset or set to -1, i.e. if the LRU
eviction policy isn't enabled. This should improve performance when using
the cache with large-scale network storage.

JAX v0.5.0

As of this release, JAX now uses effort-based versioning.
Since this release makes a breaking change to PRNG key semantics that
may require users to update their code, we are bumping the "meso" version of JAX
to signify this.

Breaking changes

Enable jax_threefry_partitionable by default (see
the update note).

This release drops support for Mac x86 wheels. Mac ARM of course remains
supported. For a recent discussion, see #22936.

Two key factors motivated this decision:

The Mac x86 build (only) has a number of test failures and crashes. We
would prefer to ship no release than a broken release.
Mac x86 hardware is end-of-life and cannot be easily obtained for
developers at this point. So it is difficult for us to fix this kind of
problem even if we wanted to.

We are open to readding support for Mac x86 if the community is willing
to help support that platform: in particular, we would need the JAX test
suite to pass cleanly on Mac x86 before we could ship releases again.

Changes:

The minimum NumPy version is now 1.25. NumPy 1.25 will remain the minimum
supported version until June 2025.
The minimum SciPy version is now 1.11. SciPy 1.11 will remain the minimum
supported version until June 2025.
jax.numpy.einsum now defaults to optimize='auto' rather than
optimize='optimal'. This avoids exponentially-scaling trace-time in
the case of many arguments (#25214).
jax.numpy.linalg.solve no longer supports batched 1D arguments
on the right hand side. To recover the previous behavior in these cases,
use solve(a, b[..., None]).squeeze(-1).

New Features

jax.numpy.fft.fftn, jax.numpy.fft.rfftn,
jax.numpy.fft.ifftn, and jax.numpy.fft.irfftn now support
transforms in more than 3 dimensions, which was previously the limit. See
#25606 for more details.
Support added for user defined state in the FFI via the new
jax.ffi.register_ffi_type_id function.
The AOT lowering .as_text() method now supports the debug_info option
to include debugging information, e.g., source location, in the output.

Deprecations

From jax.interpreters.xla, abstractify and pytype_aval_mappings
are now deprecated, having been replaced by symbols of the same name
in jax.core.
jax.scipy.special.lpmn and jax.scipy.special.lpmn_values
are deprecated, following their deprecation in SciPy v1.15.0. There are
no plans to replace these deprecated functions with new APIs.
The jax.extend.ffi submodule was moved to jax.ffi, and the
previous import path is deprecated.

Deletions

jax_enable_memories flag has been deleted and the behavior of that flag
is on by default.
From jax.lib.xla_client, the previously-deprecated Device and
XlaRuntimeError symbols have been removed; instead use jax.Device
and jax.errors.JaxRuntimeError respectively.
The jax.experimental.array_api module has been removed after being
deprecated in JAX v0.4.32. Since that release, jax.numpy supports
the array API directly.
