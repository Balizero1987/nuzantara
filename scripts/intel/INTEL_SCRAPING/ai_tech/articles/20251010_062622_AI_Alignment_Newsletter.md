Alignment Newsletter

The Alignment Newsletter is on indefinite hiatus.

I edit and write content for the Alignment Newsletter, a publication with recent content relevant to AI alignment with over 2600 subscribers. The content is biased towards work that I am personally interested in.

It turns out that people don’t notice things when they’re part of a paragraph of text, so here is:

A BIG SIGN UP LINK AND PODCAST LINK

I’d also like to highlight the

SPREADSHEET AND WEB APP OF ALL SUMMARIES IN THE NEWSLETTER

Besides that, you might want to:

Thanks to Rob Miles for creating the podcast, Georg Arndt for producing the newsletter, and Xiaohu Zhu for translating it to Chinese.

Thanks also to Dane Sherburn, Robert Kirk, Sudhanshu Kasewa, Zachary Robertson, Asya Bergal, Cody Wild, Dan Hendrycks, Flo Dorner, Matthew Barnett, and Nicholas Joseph for past content contributions to the newsletter.
