Explainers

Short, science-based introductions to key climate change topics, written by MIT faculty and researchers.

EXPLAINER
Sea Transport
Ships rely on climate-polluting fuel oil to move huge volumes of cargo. New fuels like methanol and hydrogen, nuclear reactors, batteries, and route optimization are all being explored to curb that pollution.

Climate Change Attribution
Climate change attribution is the science that links global climate change to specific weather events, explaining how big-picture changes to the climate affect our daily experience of weather.
EXPLAINER
Extreme Heat
Extreme heat is a dangerous weather condition that is becoming more common and severe as climate change warms the planet.
