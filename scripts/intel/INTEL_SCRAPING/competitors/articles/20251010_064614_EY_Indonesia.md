Tax Alert The Preliminary Stages – Applying the Arm’s Length Principle

The concept of an Indonesian Taxpayer gathering ‘proof’ during the tax audit process to support the existence and benefits of related party transactions, such as the receipt of services or the license of intangible property, is not new. However, the release of the Minister of Finance Regulation number 172 of 2023 (PMK 172) means that the time frame for Taxpayers to carry out the steps to gather this proof has moved forward to before a Local File is prepared for a specific tax year. PMK 172 also specifies that not having relevant ‘proof’ means that a related party transaction will automatically not be considered arm’s length.
