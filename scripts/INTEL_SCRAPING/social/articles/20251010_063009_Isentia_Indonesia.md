Communications

Enhance your strategic communications and media relations, be crisis ready and manage your reputation by tracking key messages, issues and audience sentiment across channels, with more accessible and easier-to-use data.

Always be the first to know with real-time alerts and real-time analytics that help you spot trends and take action to help your organisation build its reputation.

Marketing

Uncover opportunities, maximise ROI and effectively track your owned media to keep agencies accountable.

Know who, where, when and how a segment of customers is responding to key messages or campaigns and create new content people will love based on consumer insights and bespoke research.

Government

The way you work is different, and so are your needs. We know from experience that government bodies need confidence, relevance and simplicity when it comes to media intelligence.

Work with people who understand your complex needs and deliver a service you can trust. From parliamentary news monitoring and intelligence to doorsteps and press conference transcripts, our onsite team will tailor a solution that is right for you.

Agencies

Being there for your clients is about being more than a distribution service. It’s being their team on the outside, ready when the story breaks and acting as the conduit between a world of fast-moving media and strategic advice.

Make managing multiple clients easier, with tailored PR media tracking that covers thousands of sources across Print, Broadcast, Online and Social, with flexible options to suit different needs.

C-Suite

Isentia empowers you to inform everyone across your organisation, including key leaders and spokespeople, with critical media coverage which could impact reputation or strategy.

Tailored news briefings, competitor monitoring, a mobile app, real-time alerts and research can all drive decisions which help your organisation to stay competitive.

Risk & Legal

Keeping a watch on what’s being said about your organisation, people and products means you can identify and mitigate risks.

While reputation is built over time, it only takes one mishandled event to cause significant impact for your brand and bottom line.

Leverage real-time, comprehensive TV monitoring, radio monitoring, print monitoring, social media monitoring and online monitoring to stay ahead of the news at any given point in time.

Research

Get a grasp on your opportunities and challenges with more than just a ‘gut feeling’. We work with you to understand the problems you want to solve and give you the research that puts knowledge and recommendations in your hands.

Understand everything from what’s influencing buyer behaviour, to which competitors are causing shifts in your market.

Isentia delivers insights that give you the full story on your industry, customers, and partners.

Human Resources

Understand your profile in the market, locally and globally, and see how these perceptions are impacting current and future talent.

Delve deeper to unpack your reputation alongside CSR, environmental impacts, or diversity measures and use this intelligence to pull the right levers in your organisation to achieve your talent objectives.
