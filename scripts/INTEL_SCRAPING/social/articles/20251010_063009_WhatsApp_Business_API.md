WhatsApp Business Platform

The WhatsApp Business Platform gives medium to large businesses the ability to connect with customers at scale. You can start WhatsApp chat threads with your customers in minutes, send them care notifications or purchase updates, offer personalized services, and provide support in the channel that your customers prefer.

The platform consists of four primary APIs:

Cloud API, hosted by Meta
On-Premises API, which you must host (Deprecated, will be sunset October 23, 2025)
Business Management API
Marketing Messages Lite API

To send and receive messages to and from WhatsApp users, you must use either Cloud API or the On-Premises API. The preferred solution is Cloud API, due to its ease of implementation and low maintenance. Regardless of which API you end up using, you must also use the Business Management API, which is used to manage WhatsApp Business Account and message templates.
