Javanese Batik: A World-Recognized Heritage of Nusantara
Did you know that behind its beauty, every batik motif has a deep meaning and philosophy? For example, the popular parang motif symbolizes the resilience of life, while the kawung motif reflects purity and self-control. Due to its substantial cultural value and meaning, batik is not only a regional characteristic but also a symbol of the nation's cultural identity. In fact, on October 2, 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a World Intangible Cultural Heritage. A world recognition of cultural wealth that you can be proud of. Recognition of Batik by UNESCO There is a reason why UNESCO has recognized batik as a World Heritage. According to UNESCO, the process of making batik is closely tied to the techniques, symbolism, and culture of the archipelago, which are combined into a single entity. Before recognizing batik as a cultural heritage, UNESCO also conducted a lengthy assessment process, which included documentation, promotion of batik in the international world, and efforts to preserve batik from various parties. Then, the Indonesian government proposed batik as a representation of the nation's cultural wealth. Javanese batik, especially from Yogyakarta, Solo, and Pekalongan, is a strong example because the tradition of making it is still preserved today. The Meaning of Javanese Batik Motifs Javanese batik motifs are not only beautiful, but also hold deep philosophical meanings. Here are four examples of Javanese batik motifs that are often used and the meaning behind them: Parang This motif comes from the Palace of Yogyakarta and Solo, and is one of the oldest motifs. Its diagonal lines symbolize strength, courage, and perseverance in facing life's challenges. In the past, this motif was exclusive to the royal family. Kawung This batik motif also comes from Yogyakarta; the motif resembles the shape of a sliced kawung fruit (a type of palm). This motif symbolizes purity, self-control, and wisdom in action. Truntum The queen of Sunan Pakubuwana III in Solo created this motif. Truntum motifs are widely used in traditional Javanese weddings, especially by the parents of the bride and groom, because they symbolize sincere and ever-growing love. Mega Mendung Although originating from Cirebon on the north coast of West Java, mega mendung batik is often associated with the values of shade, patience and emotional control. The motif is heavily influenced by Chinese culture, reflecting a distinctive cultural acculturation. These motifs are not only an Indonesian identity, but also a philosophy of how Javanese people view life, nature, and spirituality. Development of the Local Batik Industry and MSMEs Following UNESCO's recognition, the local batik industry experienced rapid growth. Many MSMEs in the Central Java and Yogyakarta areas have begun to develop batik businesses, both in the form of written, stamped, and printed batik . It is known that the batik industry can absorb more than 200,000 workers and is spread across over 47,000 business units. Apart from being a cultural identity, batik is also an economic source that strengthens local communities. Efforts to Digitize and Promote Batik to the Global Market The Indonesian government is currently also working to digitize batik motifs through online catalogues and the integration of AI technology to detect motifs. Collaboration with young designers and modern fashion brands is also a strategy to keep batik relevant among young people and the international market. A notable example is when batik appears at the Paris Fashion Week event or when Indonesian ambassadors wear batik in international forums. These examples demonstrate that batik is not just a traditional cloth, but a heritage of the archipelago that continues to be an integral part of the nation's cultural journey. In this era of technological advancement, coupled with the high creativity of young people, batik can continue to exist and remain relevant, making it attractive to be worn as a symbol of pride and national identity. Famous Batik Markets in Indonesia If you want to see and buy batik directly from the source, some famous batik markets in Indonesia are a must-visit. There, you can find a variety of distinctive motifs from various regions, complete with their stories and uniqueness. Some popular markets include Beringharjo Market in Yogyakarta, Klewer Market in Solo, and Tanah Abang Market in Jakarta. Additionally, you can visit Trusmi Batik Village in Cirebon and Setono Betek Market in Pekalongan. In these places, you can shop and learn more about batik culture directly from the artisans. As a world-recognized cultural heritage, batik is more than just beautifully patterned fabrics. Batik is Indonesia's identity, story, and pride. From the philosophical significance of each motif to the growth of the local industry and MSMEs, batik proves itself relevant amid changing times. Especially with the support of digitalization and global promotion, batik is now increasingly known and loved, not only domestically but also internationally. So, if you have the opportunity to visit, don't hesitate to dive deeper into the beauty of batik. Start by learning its meaning, visit the center where it is made, and bring home a piece of meaningful culture.
Baluran National Park
In stark contrast to the lush green scenery found elsewhere on the island of Java, the Baluran National Park, located on the east-most edge of Java, consists predominantly of open savannahs, where wildlife roams free. Here one can watch grazing, the large Javan water buffaloes called “banteng”, small Java mouse-deer is known as “kancil”, peacocks strutting about displaying their colorful plumage, eagles flying overhead and macaques fishing for crabs with their tails. Coverning 250 sq km, the Park forms part of the district of Situbondo, in the province of East Java, comprising lowland forests, mangrove forests and 40% swathes of fertile savannahs, they provide abundant food for the animals. Here also are many typical Java trees like the Java tamarind and the pecan nut trees. Discovered by Dutchman A.H.Loredeboer, in 1937 it was designated Wildlife Refuge by the Dutch colonial authorities, and in 1980 Indonesia designated this as a National Park. At the center of this large Park stands the extinct Baluran volcano, watching over its pristine environment dominated by the dry east wind, Baluran receives on average only 3 months of rain. The rainy season in East Java being between Novembers through April, peaking in December and January, while the dry season lasts from April through October. During the dry season, the land parches and water becomes scarce, while when it rains, water slides over the black alluvial land with little being absorbed, forming water pools especially along the Park’s southern part that connects Talpat with Bama Beach. When you visit Baluran during the rainy season, you will see ample water holes, but during this time the Banteng and the wild bulls prefer to wander in the forests, although other animals like peacocks, mouse deer, and wildfowl do come out and can still be observed. Baluran National Park boasts 444 species of trees, some unique to the area like the widoro bukol ( Ziziphus rotundifolia ), mimba ( Azadirachta indica ), and pilang ( Acacia leucophloea ). These plants are able to adapt to dry conditions when others have long wilted. Other trees also remaining green are the candle trees or kemiri ( Aleurites moluccana ), gebang ( Corypha utan ), api-api ( Avicennia sp. ), the tamarind tree ( Tamarindus indica ), gadung ( Dioscorea hispida ), kendal ( Cordia obliqua ), manting ( Syzygium polyanthum ), and kepuh ( Sterculia foetida ). The Park is habitat to 26 mammal species among which are the banteng ( Bos javanicus ), wild water buffaloes ( Bubalus bubalis ), the ajag ( Cuon alpinus javanicus ), the muncak deer ( Muntiacus muntjak ), the rusa ( Cervus timorensis), leopards ( Panthera pardus ), the mouse deer ( Tragulus javanicus ), and mangrove cats ( Prionailurus viverrinus ). The Banteng are specific to Baluran and are therefore the Park’s mascot. Additionally, Baluran is habitat to 155 types of birds, among which are the rare fire kite ( Hirundo rustica ), the red forest fowl ( Gallus gallus ), kangkareng ( Anthracoceros convecus ), hornbills ( Buceros rhinoceros ), tuwuk or asian tuwur ( Eudynamys scolopacea ), peacocks ( Pavo muticus ), and herons ( Leptoptilos javanicus ). A safari trip to Baluran is indeed a precious journey. Get There To reach the Baluran National Park from Surabaya, capital of East Java, traveling overland takes around 6 hours. Baluran is located partly in the district of Situbondo and partly in the district of Banyuwangi. The Park covers a total area of 22,500 hectares comprising coastal forests and grassland and is protected by three mountains, namely Mt. Baluran, Mt. Merapi (not to be confused with Mt. Merapi near Yogyakarta) and the Ijen volcano. From Surabaya driving via the northern coastal road east you will pass the towns of Pasuruan, Probolinggo, and Situbondo. After Banyuputih, the road turns south. Do not take the road further east to the village of Bilik. Before you reach the village of Wongsorejo turn left and you will see the sign: Visitor Center. This is the entrance gate to Baluran Park. Alternatively, you can also drive from Sitobondo to Bangandengan. Some 60 km distance. The Baluran National Park is in fact on the highway connecting Surabaya with the city of Banyuwangi from where ferries take cars and passengers to Bali’s west coast. So that Baluran is also easily accessible from Bali. Now that Garuda and Wings Air also fly daily to Banyuwangi from Surabaya and Denpasar, Bali, you can take the short route from Banyuwangi to Batangan some 35 km away, and then on to Bekol which is 12 km from here and takes around 45 minutes. Within Baluran National Park you can drive through the Park to Bekol, The road takes two cars in opposite directions. Although the road is asphalted it is best to use SUV cars. From the entrance to the Bekol-Bama savannah is about 15 km. Around Bekol and Bama are trails for tourists and students.
Lake Toba
Lake Toba is an extraordinary natural wonder of the world. This enormous crater lake consists of an island almost the size of Singapore in its center. At over 1,145 square km, and a depth of 450 meters, Lake Toba is actually more like an ocean. This is the largest lake in Southeast Asia and one of the deepest lakes in the world. A Comforting Escapade Toba is a place to sit back, relax and absorb some beautiful pristine scenery. As you sit and take in the view of the picturesque mountains set against the cool clear lake, you will feel the worries of the world melt away. As the lake sits 900 meters above sea level, therefore the climate here is cooler which gives a well-needed break from the heat, humidity, and pollution of the city. How To Get There By Air You can choose between two flight routes to reach Lake Toba. The first route is from Kualanamu International Airport , Medan, to Sisingamangaraja XII International Airport (previously known as Silangit International Airport) located in Siborong-borong, North Tapanuli.

Travel agents in Medan can also organize a rental car plus a chauffeur for you. If you are coming overland from the south via Bukittinggi and Tarutung there is a public bus available. How To Get Around Feel the wind in your hair and do as the locals do by hiring a motorbike to explore this beautiful part of the world. If you’re on Samosir Island, take the day to explore by taking a drive on the road running around the edge of the island. Although rough and unpaved in places, this road offers some spectacular views of the lake from the highest points on the island. If you’re staying in the popular village of Tuk Tuk on Samosir, the best way to get around is to walk or wander, down the main street at a leisurely pace. Attraction There are many ways for you to enjoy Lake Toba’s breathtaking natural wonders . Many people said that kayaking in Lake Toba is a once-in-a-lifetime-experience. Commonly, there are three routes that you can explore by paddling the kayak, which is Tongging - Silalahi (12 km - Easy), Tongging - Samosir (50 km - Medium), and Northern Circle (175 km - Demanding). You can also savor the cool breeze from around the lake by glamping (glamorous camping) on The Kaldera Nomadic Escape. Located on Sibisa, Ajibata Sub-district, Toba Samosir Regency, you can immerse yourself in nature without having to bother with the common hassles of conventional camping. Moreover, you can also be pampered with its luxurious facilities such as Bohemian-style tents, bubble tents, eco pods, and also an amphitheater with a capacity of 300 people.

The village also dwells in many unique and authentic traditional houses, especially from Tomok, which consists of a row of massive wooden houses with striking saddle-shaped thatch roofs made of sugar palm fiber (called ijuk). Batak tribe is widely known for its festive culture. Among others, Tor-Tor Dance is considered to be the most elegant one. This traditional dance is usually performed in celebrations such as harvest time or a wedding ceremony. However, according to history, Tor-Tor Dance is used in a ritual to invoke spirit and ‘walk’ them into the stone statues, which erected as a symbol of the ancestors. Also, there is a wooden puppet called Sigale-gale, which has become a tourist attraction in Samosir Island because of the mystical value within the myth and belief surrounding the puppet itself. The locals believed that Sigale-gale can wail and dance by itself without music. Some also said that Sigale-gale can only be placed in a coffin. This statue is also commonly used in family death ceremonies in the Samosir area because Sigale-gale dance is believed by local residents to deliver the spirit of the deceased to the afterlife. Those of you who are looking for souvenirs might want to take a look at Ulos, a meticulously handwoven textile which not only functions as clothing, but also is a significant status symbol, serves as a precious heirloom, or can be a ceremonial gift during a human’s life cycle from birth and wedding to death. There are also authentic wood carvings that you can get in the souvenir shops. Don’t forget to also buy the delightful Arabica coffee beans called Sumatra Mandheling for all of you coffee-aficionado.
Borobudur
Located on the island of Java, the magnificent Borobudur temple is the world's biggest Buddhist monument you must visit at least once in your lifetime. The area is surrounded by beautiful scenery of Central Java’s nature that you can only find there. The temple sits majestically on a hilltop overlooking lush green fields and distant hills. Built between AD 780 and 840 during the reign of Syailendra dynasty, the temple's design in Gupta architecture reflects India's influence on the region. However, there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. It covers a total surface area of around 2,500 m2 of Kedu Valley, the southern part of Central Java. The monument is a marvel of design, decorated with 2,672 relief panels and originally 504 Buddha statues, surrounded by green area. The architecture and stonework of this temple have no equal. It was built without using any cement or mortar. The structure is like a set of massive interlocking Lego blocks held together without any glue. It is no wonder that Borobudur is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The temple has remained strong even through ten centuries of neglect. It was rediscovered in 1814 under the order of Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles. In the 1970s, the Indonesian Government and UNESCO worked together to restore Borobudur to its former majesty. The restoration took eight years to complete, making Borobudur one of Indonesia’s most valuable treasures. That is the reason why you will find a number of restrictions to touch or sit on the Borobudur site when you visit it. The locals really want to keep the beauty of this temple as it tells the story of their history. The temple is decorated with stone carvings in bas-relief, representing images from the life of Buddha. Commentators claim that this is the largest and most complete ensemble of Buddhist reliefs in the world, unsurpassed in artistic merit. Get Around When you plan to visit Borobudur temple, it is recommended to explore the site on foot. You may choose to walk through Green Park from the entrance. Many vendors will offer you souvenirs and other knick-knacks as you walk through this area. You can also find some Indonesian traditional souvenirs such as batik, traditional clothes of Indonesia and other interesting small display statues. Although there are regulations to prevent them from disturbing visitors, it is recommended to buy some traditional souvenirs that they sell to remember the beauty of Borobudur temple. As you climb to the top of this magnificent temple, you will marvel at the intricately detailed stone carvings displayed on its walls. You also need to pay attention to certain etiquettes when visiting this cultural site, such as dressing nicely, avoiding any kind of vandalism, keeping your attitude, respecting the religious activities that you may find when you are there and lastly, do not over-pose when taking pictures. If you happen to wear shorts during your visit, you may have to borrow sarong and wear it around your hips. While you are at the site, make sure to learn about its history and importance, which are captured on its many reliefs. Guides are available to help you learn more about this monument with some language options, so you do not need to worry about deepening your historical understanding of Borobudur temple. They will be able to walk you around the site and explain the history of the temple, beginning with its construction during the Syailendra dynasty and explaining each detail of it. The stone carvings attached to the temple display legends and stories, which have great philosophical significance. Get There Borobudur is about an one hour’s drive from Yogyakarta . The easiest way to get there is by joining a tour or renting a car. During your journey to Borobudur, you can enjoy the fresh cool air of Magelang city with its roads lined with big shady trees. Borobudur itself stands tall against the spectacular backdrop of the Menoreh mountain range that surrounds it. It is recommended to visit the site during April - October, which constitutes the dry season of the country. Also, it will be better to visit during the day instead of evening to get a clear view of the temple. When you arrive at the parking site, usually you need to walk to get to the entrance gate. For international tourists, you need to prepare for 350,000 rupiahs or 25 USD to get the tickets. If you still need to buy some snacks, there are other street vendors that sell traditional cuisine of Central Java which you might have never tasted before. Entering the temple compound is easy, and most visitors choose to wander around on foot. Alternatively, you can chart a horse-drawn carriage at a reasonable price. Those cruise passengers who disembark at Semarang can also take a day tour driving through Wonosobo to Borobudur.

5 Award-Winning Tourist Villages You Should Visit In Your Lifetime
Looking for something different to start your post-pandemic holiday? Try visiting some traditional villages and feel the new sensation of holiday that will kick some fresh start for your future travel plans. A tourism village (or ‘desa wisata’ in Indonesian) can be described as a village which has officially been designated as one that welcomes tourism. The idea was first embraced in around 2000-ish with dozens of villages in Java and Bali being assigned as tourism villages. Offering an immersive experience by taking its visitors to experience the traditional lives and blending in with the locals, tourism villages will provide an exceptional kind of trip that will enrich your perspective in life. These 5 award-winning tourism villages in Indonesia will be a great start for those of you who are eager to try something new! 1 | Pemuteran Village Bali Located near West Bali National Park and Menjangan Island, Pemuteran Village once suffered from coral reef decimation. It was 12 years ago when climate change brought a devastating impact on fishing practices and damaged three vital things to community livelihoods: local coral reef ecosystems, fisheries, and flourishing local ecotourism industry. Facing the catastrophe, the village’s residents re-established the existence of Pemuteran Village by kickstarting it as a tourism village. In 2018, Lonely Planet listed Pemuteran Village among its recommended “10 Best Destinations Asia”. Different from many tourism villages that offer cultural escape from the hustles of metropolis, Pemuteran Village also serves as the destination for diving and snorkeling. Here, you can find a large number of clownfish, parrotfish, manta rays, and whale sharks pass the waters. 2 | Penglipuran Village Bali Penglipuran Village is a tourism village which was traditionally constructed by preserving the traditional methods of bamboo architecture from Bali.

Many of the styles, such as the bamboo roof shingles, are distinctive to this community and cannot be found elsewhere. This village is located near Kintamani, set along the countryside situated among the hills. More than just a tourist village that delivers many cultural presentations, the highlight of Penglipuran Village also radiates from its cleanliness. In 2018, Penglipuran Village was recognized among the top three cleanest villages in the world according to the readers’ choice in travel magazine CN Traveler from Moscow, Russia. 3 | Nglanggeran Tourist Village Yogyakarta Among many features that can describe Nglanggeran Tourist Village , the best thing that is memorable to those who have come to visit this place is the friendliness of the locals, which will be the first thing that you found once you set your foot there. The main attraction here is of course the ancient volcano of Nglanggeran Api Purba. Admire the view of Yogyakarta from above and breathe fresh air once you arrive at the summit. Furthermore, you can also explore Nglanggeran Pond, Kedung Kandang Waterfall, and many of its cultural activities such as karawitan , jatilan , batik topeng , and more. This village has received an Award from the ASEAN Community Based Tourism (CBT) Awards in January 2017. 4 | Pentingsari Village Yogyakarta Situated 700 meters above sea level near Mount Merapi in Central Java, Pentingsari Tourist Village was recently awarded and appreciated by Sleman’s Regent for their “people’s economy” system. Since 2008, Pentingsari has been an important part of Yogyakarta's Tourism Village Project. The community still preserves the usage of traditional tools from nature. Offering many thoughtful perspectives about nature, culture, and agriculture-related to the environment, Pentingsari Village brings a deeper understanding towards nature, traditional culture, arts, and local wisdom to its visitors. 5 | Tamansari Village Banyuwangi Tamansari Tourist Village is located at the foot of Mt. Ijen, one of the world’s most peculiar craters in Banyuwangi, East Java. It’s a perfect stopping point for those of you who want to hike Ijen to see the eternal blue fire at the crater. It has earned the "Best Tourism Village Utilization" title in the category of business networking due to being a pioneer in the potential development of village tourism. The village-owned enterprises have developed a number of their business from just mere potentials, like its honey farming business, tour vehicles, guide services, and several other SMEs. Tamansari Village is also famous for producing rubber, cloves, coffee beans, and chocolates. Moreover, there are also a number of dairy farmers around the area that are expertly trained to produce high-quality dairy products.

Perfect Day Exploring Komodo National Park – Natural World Wonder
Today is the day! I will finally explore one of 7 Natural Wonders of the World and UNESCO World Heritage Site - Komodo national park and it's surroundings! Yesterday I came to Labuan Bajo, which is just 1 hour flight from Bali. It's a small city and a gateway to explore the Komodo National park. The tourist part of the city is filled with hotels and small travel agencies, where I have bought a tour to explore the Komodo National park by boat. Night brought me a stunning sunset, one of the most beautiful I ever saw. Image by: Alex Block After admiring it, I went to bed as I have to wake up very early to make the most of my day at one of the most beautiful places in the World! Image by: Alex Block My boat has started at 5-30am from the harbor, so I had a chance to enjoy calm and beautiful sunrise while sailing to our first stop with a cup of coffee in my hands. I am lucky: we got the beautiful weather and clear blue sky! Image by: Alex Block In 3 hours we get to Padar island, probably the most picturesque place in Komodo national park. It completely inhabited island with one of the most beautiful views from the top in the World. Short hiking to the hill (maybe 15-20 minutes if you are fit) and I made it to amazing spot with the view to 3 stunning beaches around! That’s a mind-blowing view! Image by: Alex Block Next stop - Rinca island. It is part of Komodo park and one of 2 places in the world where you can meet Komodo dragons (the second place is Komodo island itself). For safety, you have to go with the guide, who is there to help you find dragons and make sure you are safe. We are lucky as we meet 7 dragons during our visit including a small baby dragon. Really dangerous and big creatures, though I felt completely safe even while making this classical picture! Image by: Alex Block Time to swim! Our next stop was a beautiful Pink beach with amazing crystal clear blue water, where even without swimming, you can see the corals. We took a small «taxi», which brought us to the beach. The Pink beach itself is a dream. Apart from us, there was no one else there, so we had fun swimming, enjoying the natural calm beach with the real pink sand! Image by: Alex Block Our 4th stop was the most adventurous one! We have stopped in the middle of the park to see one of the wonders of it: gorgeous huge mantas. Even more: you can easily swim with them if you dare to get to the water! Image by: Alex Block I got back to my hotel after 7 pm! It was definitely a long day, but one of the most amazing I ever had! Wonderful Indonesia! Written by Alex Block Photo source of image header banner: Alex Block
Javanese Batik: A World-Recognized Heritage of Nusantara
Did you know that behind its beauty, every batik motif has a deep meaning and philosophy? For example, the popular parang motif symbolizes the resilience of life, while the kawung motif reflects purity and self-control. Due to its substantial cultural value and meaning, batik is not only a regional characteristic but also a symbol of the nation's cultural identity. In fact, on October 2, 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a World Intangible Cultural Heritage. A world recognition of cultural wealth that you can be proud of. Recognition of Batik by UNESCO There is a reason why UNESCO has recognized batik as a World Heritage. According to UNESCO, the process of making batik is closely tied to the techniques, symbolism, and culture of the archipelago, which are combined into a single entity. Before recognizing batik as a cultural heritage, UNESCO also conducted a lengthy assessment process, which included documentation, promotion of batik in the international world, and efforts to preserve batik from various parties. Then, the Indonesian government proposed batik as a representation of the nation's cultural wealth. Javanese batik, especially from Yogyakarta, Solo, and Pekalongan, is a strong example because the tradition of making it is still preserved today. The Meaning of Javanese Batik Motifs Javanese batik motifs are not only beautiful, but also hold deep philosophical meanings. Here are four examples of Javanese batik motifs that are often used and the meaning behind them: Parang This motif comes from the Palace of Yogyakarta and Solo, and is one of the oldest motifs. Its diagonal lines symbolize strength, courage, and perseverance in facing life's challenges. In the past, this motif was exclusive to the royal family. Kawung This batik motif also comes from Yogyakarta; the motif resembles the shape of a sliced kawung fruit (a type of palm). This motif symbolizes purity, self-control, and wisdom in action. Truntum The queen of Sunan Pakubuwana III in Solo created this motif. Truntum motifs are widely used in traditional Javanese weddings, especially by the parents of the bride and groom, because they symbolize sincere and ever-growing love. Mega Mendung Although originating from Cirebon on the north coast of West Java, mega mendung batik is often associated with the values of shade, patience and emotional control. The motif is heavily influenced by Chinese culture, reflecting a distinctive cultural acculturation. These motifs are not only an Indonesian identity, but also a philosophy of how Javanese people view life, nature, and spirituality. Development of the Local Batik Industry and MSMEs Following UNESCO's recognition, the local batik industry experienced rapid growth. Many MSMEs in the Central Java and Yogyakarta areas have begun to develop batik businesses, both in the form of written, stamped, and printed batik . It is known that the batik industry can absorb more than 200,000 workers and is spread across over 47,000 business units. Apart from being a cultural identity, batik is also an economic source that strengthens local communities. Efforts to Digitize and Promote Batik to the Global Market The Indonesian government is currently also working to digitize batik motifs through online catalogues and the integration of AI technology to detect motifs. Collaboration with young designers and modern fashion brands is also a strategy to keep batik relevant among young people and the international market. A notable example is when batik appears at the Paris Fashion Week event or when Indonesian ambassadors wear batik in international forums. These examples demonstrate that batik is not just a traditional cloth, but a heritage of the archipelago that continues to be an integral part of the nation's cultural journey. In this era of technological advancement, coupled with the high creativity of young people, batik can continue to exist and remain relevant, making it attractive to be worn as a symbol of pride and national identity. Famous Batik Markets in Indonesia If you want to see and buy batik directly from the source, some famous batik markets in Indonesia are a must-visit. There, you can find a variety of distinctive motifs from various regions, complete with their stories and uniqueness. Some popular markets include Beringharjo Market in Yogyakarta, Klewer Market in Solo, and Tanah Abang Market in Jakarta. Additionally, you can visit Trusmi Batik Village in Cirebon and Setono Betek Market in Pekalongan. In these places, you can shop and learn more about batik culture directly from the artisans. As a world-recognized cultural heritage, batik is more than just beautifully patterned fabrics. Batik is Indonesia's identity, story, and pride. From the philosophical significance of each motif to the growth of the local industry and MSMEs, batik proves itself relevant amid changing times. Especially with the support of digitalization and global promotion, batik is now increasingly known and loved, not only domestically but also internationally. So, if you have the opportunity to visit, don't hesitate to dive deeper into the beauty of batik. Start by learning its meaning, visit the center where it is made, and bring home a piece of meaningful culture.
Baluran National Park
In stark contrast to the lush green scenery found elsewhere on the island of Java, the Baluran National Park, located on the east-most edge of Java, consists predominantly of open savannahs, where wildlife roams free. Here one can watch grazing, the large Javan water buffaloes called “banteng”, small Java mouse-deer is known as “kancil”, peacocks strutting about displaying their colorful plumage, eagles flying overhead and macaques fishing for crabs with their tails. Coverning 250 sq km, the Park forms part of the district of Situbondo, in the province of East Java, comprising lowland forests, mangrove forests and 40% swathes of fertile savannahs, they provide abundant food for the animals. Here also are many typical Java trees like the Java tamarind and the pecan nut trees. Discovered by Dutchman A.H.Loredeboer, in 1937 it was designated Wildlife Refuge by the Dutch colonial authorities, and in 1980 Indonesia designated this as a National Park. At the center of this large Park stands the extinct Baluran volcano, watching over its pristine environment dominated by the dry east wind, Baluran receives on average only 3 months of rain. The rainy season in East Java being between Novembers through April, peaking in December and January, while the dry season lasts from April through October. During the dry season, the land parches and water becomes scarce, while when it rains, water slides over the black alluvial land with little being absorbed, forming water pools especially along the Park’s southern part that connects Talpat with Bama Beach. When you visit Baluran during the rainy season, you will see ample water holes, but during this time the Banteng and the wild bulls prefer to wander in the forests, although other animals like peacocks, mouse deer, and wildfowl do come out and can still be observed. Baluran National Park boasts 444 species of trees, some unique to the area like the widoro bukol ( Ziziphus rotundifolia ), mimba ( Azadirachta indica ), and pilang ( Acacia leucophloea ). These plants are able to adapt to dry conditions when others have long wilted. Other trees also remaining green are the candle trees or kemiri ( Aleurites moluccana ), gebang ( Corypha utan ), api-api ( Avicennia sp. ), the tamarind tree ( Tamarindus indica ), gadung ( Dioscorea hispida ), kendal ( Cordia obliqua ), manting ( Syzygium polyanthum ), and kepuh ( Sterculia foetida ). The Park is habitat to 26 mammal species among which are the banteng ( Bos javanicus ), wild water buffaloes ( Bubalus bubalis ), the ajag ( Cuon alpinus javanicus ), the muncak deer ( Muntiacus muntjak ), the rusa ( Cervus timorensis), leopards ( Panthera pardus ), the mouse deer ( Tragulus javanicus ), and mangrove cats ( Prionailurus viverrinus ). The Banteng are specific to Baluran and are therefore the Park’s mascot. Additionally, Baluran is habitat to 155 types of birds, among which are the rare fire kite ( Hirundo rustica ), the red forest fowl ( Gallus gallus ), kangkareng ( Anthracoceros convecus ), hornbills ( Buceros rhinoceros ), tuwuk or asian tuwur ( Eudynamys scolopacea ), peacocks ( Pavo muticus ), and herons ( Leptoptilos javanicus ). A safari trip to Baluran is indeed a precious journey. Get There To reach the Baluran National Park from Surabaya, capital of East Java, traveling overland takes around 6 hours. Baluran is located partly in the district of Situbondo and partly in the district of Banyuwangi. The Park covers a total area of 22,500 hectares comprising coastal forests and grassland and is protected by three mountains, namely Mt. Baluran, Mt. Merapi (not to be confused with Mt. Merapi near Yogyakarta) and the Ijen volcano. From Surabaya driving via the northern coastal road east you will pass the towns of Pasuruan, Probolinggo, and Situbondo.

The Baluran National Park is in fact on the highway connecting Surabaya with the city of Banyuwangi from where ferries take cars and passengers to Bali’s west coast. So that Baluran is also easily accessible from Bali. Now that Garuda and Wings Air also fly daily to Banyuwangi from Surabaya and Denpasar, Bali, you can take the short route from Banyuwangi to Batangan some 35 km away, and then on to Bekol which is 12 km from here and takes around 45 minutes.

If you’re staying in the popular village of Tuk Tuk on Samosir, the best way to get around is to walk or wander, down the main street at a leisurely pace. Attraction There are many ways for you to enjoy Lake Toba’s breathtaking natural wonders . Many people said that kayaking in Lake Toba is a once-in-a-lifetime-experience.

Batak tribe is widely known for its festive culture. Among others, Tor-Tor Dance is considered to be the most elegant one. This traditional dance is usually performed in celebrations such as harvest time or a wedding ceremony. However, according to history, Tor-Tor Dance is used in a ritual to invoke spirit and ‘walk’ them into the stone statues, which erected as a symbol of the ancestors. Also, there is a wooden puppet called Sigale-gale, which has become a tourist attraction in Samosir Island because of the mystical value within the myth and belief surrounding the puppet itself. The locals believed that Sigale-gale can wail and dance by itself without music. Some also said that Sigale-gale can only be placed in a coffin. This statue is also commonly used in family death ceremonies in the Samosir area because Sigale-gale dance is believed by local residents to deliver the spirit of the deceased to the afterlife.

Built between AD 780 and 840 during the reign of Syailendra dynasty, the temple's design in Gupta architecture reflects India's influence on the region. However, there are enough indigenous scenes and elements incorporated to make Borobudur uniquely Indonesian. It covers a total surface area of around 2,500 m2 of Kedu Valley, the southern part of Central Java.

It was built without using any cement or mortar. The structure is like a set of massive interlocking Lego blocks held together without any glue. It is no wonder that Borobudur is listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The temple has remained strong even through ten centuries of neglect. It was rediscovered in 1814 under the order of Sir Thomas Stanford Raffles. In the 1970s, the Indonesian Government and UNESCO worked together to restore Borobudur to its former majesty. The restoration took eight years to complete, making Borobudur one of Indonesia’s most valuable treasures. That is the reason why you will find a number of restrictions to touch or sit on the Borobudur site when you visit it. The locals really want to keep the beauty of this temple as it tells the story of their history. The temple is decorated with stone carvings in bas-relief, representing images from the life of Buddha. Commentators claim that this is the largest and most complete ensemble of Buddhist reliefs in the world, unsurpassed in artistic merit. Get Around When you plan to visit Borobudur temple, it is recommended to explore the site on foot. You may choose to walk through Green Park from the entrance.

If you happen to wear shorts during your visit, you may have to borrow sarong and wear it around your hips. While you are at the site, make sure to learn about its history and importance, which are captured on its many reliefs. Guides are available to help you learn more about this monument with some language options, so you do not need to worry about deepening your historical understanding of Borobudur temple. They will be able to walk you around the site and explain the history of the temple, beginning with its construction during the Syailendra dynasty and explaining each detail of it.

The easiest way to get there is by joining a tour or renting a car. During your journey to Borobudur, you can enjoy the fresh cool air of Magelang city with its roads lined with big shady trees. Borobudur itself stands tall against the spectacular backdrop of the Menoreh mountain range that surrounds it. It is recommended to visit the site during April - October, which constitutes the dry season of the country. Also, it will be better to visit during the day instead of evening to get a clear view of the temple. When you arrive at the parking site, usually you need to walk to get to the entrance gate. For international tourists, you need to prepare for 350,000 rupiahs or 25 USD to get the tickets. If you still need to buy some snacks, there are other street vendors that sell traditional cuisine of Central Java which you might have never tasted before.

5 Award-Winning Tourist Villages You Should Visit In Your Lifetime
Looking for something different to start your post-pandemic holiday? Try visiting some traditional villages and feel the new sensation of holiday that will kick some fresh start for your future travel plans. A tourism village (or ‘desa wisata’ in Indonesian) can be described as a village which has officially been designated as one that welcomes tourism. The idea was first embraced in around 2000-ish with dozens of villages in Java and Bali being assigned as tourism villages. Offering an immersive experience by taking its visitors to experience the traditional lives and blending in with the locals, tourism villages will provide an exceptional kind of trip that will enrich your perspective in life. These 5 award-winning tourism villages in Indonesia will be a great start for those of you who are eager to try something new! 1 | Pemuteran Village Bali Located near West Bali National Park and Menjangan Island, Pemuteran Village once suffered from coral reef decimation. It was 12 years ago when climate change brought a devastating impact on fishing practices and damaged three vital things to community livelihoods: local coral reef ecosystems, fisheries, and flourishing local ecotourism industry. Facing the catastrophe, the village’s residents re-established the existence of Pemuteran Village by kickstarting it as a tourism village. In 2018, Lonely Planet listed Pemuteran Village among its recommended “10 Best Destinations Asia”.

This village is located near Kintamani, set along the countryside situated among the hills. More than just a tourist village that delivers many cultural presentations, the highlight of Penglipuran Village also radiates from its cleanliness.

Since 2008, Pentingsari has been an important part of Yogyakarta's Tourism Village Project. The community still preserves the usage of traditional tools from nature. Offering many thoughtful perspectives about nature, culture, and agriculture-related to the environment, Pentingsari Village brings a deeper understanding towards nature, traditional culture, arts, and local wisdom to its visitors. 5 | Tamansari Village Banyuwangi Tamansari Tourist Village is located at the foot of Mt. Ijen, one of the world’s most peculiar craters in Banyuwangi, East Java. It’s a perfect stopping point for those of you who want to hike Ijen to see the eternal blue fire at the crater.

Perfect Day Exploring Komodo National Park – Natural World Wonder
Today is the day! I will finally explore one of 7 Natural Wonders of the World and UNESCO World Heritage Site - Komodo national park and it's surroundings! Yesterday I came to Labuan Bajo, which is just 1 hour flight from Bali. It's a small city and a gateway to explore the Komodo National park. The tourist part of the city is filled with hotels and small travel agencies, where I have bought a tour to explore the Komodo National park by boat. Night brought me a stunning sunset, one of the most beautiful I ever saw. Image by: Alex Block After admiring it, I went to bed as I have to wake up very early to make the most of my day at one of the most beautiful places in the World! Image by: Alex Block My boat has started at 5-30am from the harbor, so I had a chance to enjoy calm and beautiful sunrise while sailing to our first stop with a cup of coffee in my hands. I am lucky: we got the beautiful weather and clear blue sky! Image by: Alex Block In 3 hours we get to Padar island, probably the most picturesque place in Komodo national park. It completely inhabited island with one of the most beautiful views from the top in the World. Short hiking to the hill (maybe 15-20 minutes if you are fit) and I made it to amazing spot with the view to 3 stunning beaches around! That’s a mind-blowing view! Image by: Alex Block Next stop - Rinca island. It is part of Komodo park and one of 2 places in the world where you can meet Komodo dragons (the second place is Komodo island itself). For safety, you have to go with the guide, who is there to help you find dragons and make sure you are safe. We are lucky as we meet 7 dragons during our visit including a small baby dragon. Really dangerous and big creatures, though I felt completely safe even while making this classical picture! Image by: Alex Block Time to swim! Our next stop was a beautiful Pink beach with amazing crystal clear blue water, where even without swimming, you can see the corals. We took a small «taxi», which brought us to the beach. The Pink beach itself is a dream. Apart from us, there was no one else there, so we had fun swimming, enjoying the natural calm beach with the real pink sand! Image by: Alex Block Our 4th stop was the most adventurous one! We have stopped in the middle of the park to see one of the wonders of it: gorgeous huge mantas. Even more: you can easily swim with them if you dare to get to the water! Image by: Alex Block I got back to my hotel after 7 pm! It was definitely a long day, but one of the most amazing I ever had! Wonderful Indonesia! Written by Alex Block Photo source of image header banner: Alex Block
Javanese Batik: A World-Recognized Heritage of Nusantara
Did you know that behind its beauty, every batik motif has a deep meaning and philosophy? For example, the popular parang motif symbolizes the resilience of life, while the kawung motif reflects purity and self-control. Due to its substantial cultural value and meaning, batik is not only a regional characteristic but also a symbol of the nation's cultural identity. In fact, on October 2, 2009, UNESCO designated Indonesian batik as a World Intangible Cultural Heritage. A world recognition of cultural wealth that you can be proud of. Recognition of Batik by UNESCO There is a reason why UNESCO has recognized batik as a World Heritage. According to UNESCO, the process of making batik is closely tied to the techniques, symbolism, and culture of the archipelago, which are combined into a single entity. Before recognizing batik as a cultural heritage, UNESCO also conducted a lengthy assessment process, which included documentation, promotion of batik in the international world, and efforts to preserve batik from various parties. Then, the Indonesian government proposed batik as a representation of the nation's cultural wealth. Javanese batik, especially from Yogyakarta, Solo, and Pekalongan, is a strong example because the tradition of making it is still preserved today. The Meaning of Javanese Batik Motifs Javanese batik motifs are not only beautiful, but also hold deep philosophical meanings. Here are four examples of Javanese batik motifs that are often used and the meaning behind them: Parang This motif comes from the Palace of Yogyakarta and Solo, and is one of the oldest motifs. Its diagonal lines symbolize strength, courage, and perseverance in facing life's challenges. In the past, this motif was exclusive to the royal family. Kawung This batik motif also comes from Yogyakarta; the motif resembles the shape of a sliced kawung fruit (a type of palm). This motif symbolizes purity, self-control, and wisdom in action. Truntum The queen of Sunan Pakubuwana III in Solo created this motif. Truntum motifs are widely used in traditional Javanese weddings, especially by the parents of the bride and groom, because they symbolize sincere and ever-growing love. Mega Mendung Although originating from Cirebon on the north coast of West Java, mega mendung batik is often associated with the values of shade, patience and emotional control. The motif is heavily influenced by Chinese culture, reflecting a distinctive cultural acculturation. These motifs are not only an Indonesian identity, but also a philosophy of how Javanese people view life, nature, and spirituality. Development of the Local Batik Industry and MSMEs Following UNESCO's recognition, the local batik industry experienced rapid growth. Many MSMEs in the Central Java and Yogyakarta areas have begun to develop batik businesses, both in the form of written, stamped, and printed batik . It is known that the batik industry can absorb more than 200,000 workers and is spread across over 47,000 business units. Apart from being a cultural identity, batik is also an economic source that strengthens local communities. Efforts to Digitize and Promote Batik to the Global Market The Indonesian government is currently also working to digitize batik motifs through online catalogues and the integration of AI technology to detect motifs. Collaboration with young designers and modern fashion brands is also a strategy to keep batik relevant among young people and the international market. A notable example is when batik appears at the Paris Fashion Week event or when Indonesian ambassadors wear batik in international forums. These examples demonstrate that batik is not just a traditional cloth, but a heritage of the archipelago that continues to be an integral part of the nation's cultural journey. In this era of technological advancement, coupled with the high creativity of young people, batik can continue to exist and remain relevant, making it attractive to be worn as a symbol of pride and national identity. Famous Batik Markets in Indonesia If you want to see and buy batik directly from the source, some famous batik markets in Indonesia are a must-visit. There, you can find a variety of distinctive motifs from various regions, complete with their stories and uniqueness. Some popular markets include Beringharjo Market in Yogyakarta, Klewer Market in Solo, and Tanah Abang Market in Jakarta. Additionally, you can visit Trusmi Batik Village in Cirebon and Setono Betek Market in Pekalongan. In these places, you can shop and learn more about batik culture directly from the artisans. As a world-recognized cultural heritage, batik is more than just beautifully patterned fabrics. Batik is Indonesia's identity, story, and pride. From the philosophical significance of each motif to the growth of the local industry and MSMEs, batik proves itself relevant amid changing times. Especially with the support of digitalization and global promotion, batik is now increasingly known and loved, not only domestically but also internationally. So, if you have the opportunity to visit, don't hesitate to dive deeper into the beauty of batik. Start by learning its meaning, visit the center where it is made, and bring home a piece of meaningful culture.
