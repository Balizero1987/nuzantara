Getting Real (small) With Compression Dictionaries
by Patrick Meenan

Compression dictionary transport is a relatively new feature in HTTP that allows for using custom compression dictionaries to improve the compression of HTTP responses. The results can be pretty dramatic, with responses anywhere from 60-90+% smaller than using the best non-dictionary compression currently available.

Correlation or Causation: How web performance proves its value
by Emilie Wilhelm

As web performance experts, we‚Äôre all familiar with the oft-cited examples: Amazon, Walmart, and their gains or losses directly tied to page loading speeds.

Data-Driven SEO and Web Performance

The readers of this calendar know that web performance is important. A faster site means happier users, better conversion rates, and, according to Google, higher SEO rankings.

When users interact
by Philip Tellis

When looking at the Core Web Vitals, we often try optimizing each independently of the others, but that‚Äôs not how users experience the web. A user‚Äôs web experience is made up of many metrics, and it‚Äôs important to look at these metrics together for each experience. Real User Measurement (RUM) allows us to do that [‚Ä¶]
