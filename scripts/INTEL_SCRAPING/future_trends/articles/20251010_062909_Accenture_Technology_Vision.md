AI: A Declaration of Autonomy—Is trust the limit of AI’s limitless possibilities?

10-MINUTE READ

 

JANUARY 7, 2025

In brief
Leaders must prepare today for an imminent world in which AI is everywhere and acting autonomously on behalf of people.


New autonomy for AI also means new autonomy for systems and people, and a refined relationship with trust.


Opportunities will be lost unless business leaders secure enough trust from employees and consumers to engage with AI's unprecedented capabilities.

Accelerating Autonomy with the Cognitive Digital Brain

As executives race to implement AI, they need to look past the separate pieces to see the full scope of what they are building: AI “cognitive digital brains.” Intentionally bringing all their efforts together, they can hard-code workflows, institutional knowledge, value chains, social interactions, and other data into a system that understands—and acts with autonomy—at a higher level than ever before.

4 Emerging Trends of AI, autonomy and trust:

Our technology trends explore what happens when AI acts autonomously at the center of enterprise technology, speaks on behalf of your brand, inhabits robotic bodies and collaborates on behalf of employees.

01
The Binary Big Bang: When AI expands exponentially, systems are upended
As gen AI becomes central to enterprise tech, development costs plummet, new systems abound, and digital agents gain autonomy—transforming applications as we know them.
02
Your Face, in the Future: Differentiating when every interface looks the same
AI Agents can personalize customer interactions at scale, but brands must protect their unique voice to avoid becoming generic.
03
When LLMs Get Their Bodies: How foundation models reinvent robotics
Robots with embedded LLMs have generalist versatility, enabling them to take on new tasks in human spaces beyond today’s highly-programmed use cases.
04
The New Learning Loop: How people and AI are defining a virtuous cycle of learning, leading, and creating
When gen AI is diffused through an organization, every employee has the full power of their organization behind them, which expands the autonomy of both people and AI over time.
