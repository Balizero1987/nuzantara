The Alignment Research Center (ARC) is a non-profit research organization whose mission is to align future machine learning systems with human interests. Our current and previous work consists of two projects:

Theoretical Research

The Theory team is developing an alignÂ­ment strategy that could be adopted in industry today while scaling gracefully to future ML systems. Learn more at alignment.org/theory

Model Evaluations

The Evaluations team was incubated at ARC and has now spun off as METR, a new 501(c)(3). They are building capability evaluations of frontier machine learning models. Learn more at metr.org
