Technology Transfer and Spinoffs

The NASA Technology Transfer program ensures that innovations developed for exploration and discovery are broadly available to the public, maximizing the benefit to the nation. NASA ensures inventions for space find practical uses closer to home. They often become solutions to different challenges – ones we didn’t set out to solve. Called NASA spinoffs, these technologies benefit life on Earth in the form of commercial products. 

Space Travel

The path to the Moon, Mars, and beyond requires technologies to get us where we need to go quickly, safely and efficiently. Space travel includes launch and in-space propulsion systems, cryogenic fluid management, and thermal management, as well as navigation and landing systems to get our supplies, equipment, and robotic or human explorers to diverse surface destinations.  

Living in Space

Technologies for living in space enable our robotic and human explorers to achieve their mission goals. This means everything from having power to do their work, to the habitats or spacecraft they’ll call home. Our astronauts also need technologies to make food and eat, exercise, sleep and maintain their overall wellbeing.  

Manufacturing and Materials

Advanced manufacturing technologies for both terrestrial and in-space purposes will make commercial and exploration missions more efficient and affordable. We’re developing new materials with improved or combined properties, learning how to build infrastructure and innovating on manufacturing processes. 

Robotics

NASA uses robotic systems to explore other planets and objects in our solar system as precursors to crewed missions, assist astronauts on the International Space Station, study the universe, and much more. This also includes autonomous systems that enable robotics, spacecraft and aircraft to operate in a dynamic environment independent of external control. 

Science Instruments

Science instruments are state-of-the-art tools for acquiring information about planetary geology, atmosphere, and environmental conditions. This includes technologies for remote sensing, mapping and observation capabilities, analyzing light from the universe, and even searching for signs of life. 

High-Tech Computing

Space-qualified computing technology is designed to address the most computationally-intensive part of a mission. But for the future, NASA is going to need more power and more processing capabilities. We also work on modeling and simulation tech, software, and unique electronics and computing hardware for flight systems, whether in space or the atmosphere. 

Space Communications

Reliable space communication systems are critical to every NASA mission. Spacecraft commands, never-before-seen images, and scientific data are sent and received daily by NASA's giant antennas on Earth. From the Voyager mission exploring beyond our solar system, to astronauts onboard the International Space Station, space communications provide the crucial connection to our home planet. 

Starling

NASA’s Starling mission is advancing the readiness of various technologies for cooperative groups of spacecraft – also known as distributed missions, clusters, or swarms. Starling will demonstrate technologies to enable multipoint science data collection by several small spacecraft flying in swarms. The six-month mission will use four CubeSats in low-Earth orbit to test four technologies that let spacecraft operate in a synchronized manner without resources from the ground.
