BCG in Jakarta was founded in 1995 and is located in the heart of the city’s central business district. The BCG Jakarta office building—with its classical architecture and strategic location—is an excellent home for BCGers. The consultants work on projects throughout the region, gaining exposure to the breadth of the region’s economy through hands-on experience with a diverse mix of clients.

Who We Work With

The client portfolio includes leading firms in Indonesia and across Southeast Asia, state-owned enterprises, multinational corporations, and government agencies. Jakarta has helped its clients put in place structural changes that have played a key role in the development of Indonesia’s economy.

Our Office Culture

We recruit across the world and offer opportunities for dynamic and rewarding professional careers. Our staff includes individuals with eclectic backgrounds. The Jakarta office employs people of more than ten nationalities, and educational backgrounds range from business administration to engineering, astronomy, and public policy. The Jakarta team has a strong bond and enjoy taking part in events such as our fun office outing, team competition, and various performances, including dancing, singing, and more.

The BCG Jakarta team commitment goes beyond our professional work. We actively run a social-impact program in which the team works voluntarily to give back to the community. We mentor university students, which allows us to develop the young bright minds of the nation. Moreover, we engage in orchestrating the social entrepreneurship environment to help the system grow and have a bigger impact on the country’s economy.
