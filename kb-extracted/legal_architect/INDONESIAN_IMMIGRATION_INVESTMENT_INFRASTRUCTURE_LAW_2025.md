**Fair Replacement Value** (SPI 306):
- **NJOP (Nilai Jual Objek Pajak)** - tax-assessed value (updated annually by local government)
- **Market comparables** (recent sales of similar land in same area)
- **Productive capacity** (for agricultural land - estimated income from crops over 5 years)

**Typical Compensation Multiples**:
- Urban land (Jakarta, Surabaya, Bali): 1.2x - 1.5x NJOP
- Suburban land: 1.0x - 1.2x NJOP
- Agricultural land: 0.8x - 1.0x NJOP + crop compensation

- Compensation MUST be "fair and proper"
- BUT determination by licensed appraiser is **final and binding**
- Landowner can object to District Court, but court decision is **final** (no appeal to Supreme Court)

**Government Power of Eminent Domain**:
> Once compensation deposited into court, government can proceed with land acquisition even if landowner objects

**No Negotiation on Price**:
> Appraisal by licensed appraiser (KJPP) is **NOT negotiable** (unlike private land purchase transactions)

**Mandatory Public Consultation**:
- Government MUST hold minimum 2 public consultation meetings within 14 days of land acquisition announcement
- Landowners can voice concerns, but consultation is **NOT a veto** (government can proceed even if landowners object)
