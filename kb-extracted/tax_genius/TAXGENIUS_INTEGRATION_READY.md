## 🧮 Key Formulas - Quick Reference

### Corporate Tax (PPh 25)
```typescript
// Small business (revenue < IDR 4.8B)
const pp23Tax = monthlyRevenue * 0.005; // 0.5% final tax

// Regular corporate (revenue >= IDR 4.8B)
const taxableIncome = annualProfit; // After fiscal reconciliation
const corporateTax = taxableIncome * 0.22; // 22% standard rate
```

### NPWPD (Bali Hospitality)
```typescript
// Replaces VAT for F&B, accommodation in Bali
const npwpd = monthlyRevenue * 0.10; // 10% on gross revenue
```

### Employee Tax (PPh 21) - Progressive
```typescript
const brackets = [
  { limit: 60000000, rate: 0.05 },    // 5% up to IDR 60M
  { limit: 250000000, rate: 0.15 },   // 15% IDR 60M-250M
  { limit: 500000000, rate: 0.25 },   // 25% IDR 250M-500M
  { limit: 5000000000, rate: 0.30 },  // 30% IDR 500M-5B
  { limit: Infinity, rate: 0.35 }     // 35% above IDR 5B
];
```

### BPJS (Health + Employment)
```typescript
const maxBase = 12000000; // IDR 12M cap
const actualBase = Math.min(monthlySalary, maxBase);

const bpjsHealth = actualBase * 0.04; // 4% employer + 1% employee
const bpjsEmployment = actualBase * 0.0624; // 6.24% employer + 2% employee
const totalEmployer = actualBase * (0.04 + 0.0624);
const totalEmployee = actualBase * (0.01 + 0.02);
```

### Villa Final Tax (PPh 4(2))
```typescript
const finalTax = monthlyRentalIncome * 0.10; // 10% on gross (final)
```

### Withholding Tax (PPh 23)
```typescript
const services = grossPayment * 0.02; // 2% services (consulting, legal, etc.)
const rental = grossPayment * 0.02;   // 2% rental (equipment, building)
```

### E-commerce Withholding (PMK 37/2025)
```typescript
// Effective July 14, 2025 (if revenue IDR 500M-4.8B/year)

```

### Crypto Tax (Effective August 1, 2025)

```

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls - Alert TaxGenius Users

### 1. Service Charge ≠ Revenue (F&B)
- **Issue**: Service charge 10% must be distributed to employees (not business income)
- **Calculation**: `taxableRevenue = grossRevenue - serviceCharge`
- **Alert**: "If service charge not distributed = taxable income + labor violation"

### 2. Entertainment Expenses (50% Deductible)
- **Issue**: Only 50% deductible for corporate tax
- **Fiscal Reconciliation**: Add back 50% to accounting profit
- **Alert**: "Entertainment IDR [X]M → Add back IDR [Y]M for tax purposes"

### 3. VAT Input Credit BLOCKED (Entertainment)
- **Issue**: Entertainment VAT input = 100% non-deductible
- **Impact**: Cannot claim refund on entertainment VAT
- **Alert**: "Entertainment VAT IDR [X]M cannot be claimed (100% blocked)"

### 4. Loss Carryforward Expiry (5 Years)
- **Issue**: Losses expire after 5 years (set reminder!)
- **Alert**: "IDR [X]M losses expire [Date]. Utilize within [Y] months or forfeit."
- **Recommendation**: Accelerate income to offset losses before expiry

### 5. PP 23/2018 = NO Loss Carryforward
- **Issue**: 0.5% final tax = cannot utilize prior year losses
- **Trade-off**: Simplicity vs tax savings
- **Decision Rule**: If accumulated losses > IDR 500M, stay on regular tax (22%) to utilize losses

### 6. Transfer Pricing Documentation Deadline (4 Months)
- **Issue**: Local File due 4 months after year-end
- **Penalty**: 50% of underpaid tax if inadequate
- **Alert**: "Local File deadline: [Date]. Cost IDR 30M-50M (TP consultant)."

### 7. LKPM Quarterly Filing (PT PMA)
- **Issue**: 3 warnings = KITAS suspension (2025 STRICTER)
- **Deadlines**: Apr 10, Jul 10, Oct 10, Jan 10
- **Alert**: "LKPM Q[X] due in [Y] days. NIL report REQUIRED even if no activity."

### 8. Foreign Tax Credit Requires Certificate
- **Issue**: Cannot claim foreign tax credit without Certificate of Residency
- **Processing**: 2-4 weeks from home country tax authority
- **Alert**: "Claim foreign tax credit saves IDR [X]M. Apply for Certificate now (2-4 weeks)."

### 9. E-commerce Withholding = PP 23/2018 Rate (Same!)
- **Issue**: 0.5% withheld by marketplace = same as PP 23/2018 tax
- **Result**: Net additional tax = IDR 0 (already withheld)
- **Alert**: "No manual payment needed. Receive Bukti Potong from marketplace, report in annual return."

### 10. Crypto Foreign Exchange = 5x Tax Increase (Aug 2025)
- **Issue**: Binance, etc. = 1% (vs 0.21% domestic = 79% higher)
- **Recommendation**: Switch to Indodax, Tokocrypto
- **Savings**: IDR [X]M/year (calculate based on trading volume)
