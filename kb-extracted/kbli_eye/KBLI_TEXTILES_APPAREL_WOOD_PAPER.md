|---------------|---------|----------|-------| ### Timeline to Operations | Risk Level | Timeline | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| **Low (R)** | 6-8 months | NIB only (self-declaration), fastest |
| **Medium-Low (MR)** | 8-10 months | NIB + Standard Certificate (self-declaration) |
| **Medium-High (MT)** | 10-14 months | NIB + Standard Certificate (verified) |
| **High (T)** | 14-36 months | NIB + Standard Certificate + Operating License + AMDAL (environmental assessment) | **Fastest Setups** (6-8 months):
- KBLI 1392 (Made-up textiles - bedding, towels)
- KBLI 1394 (Cordage, rope)
- KBLI 1623 (Wooden containers) **Slowest Setups** (24-36 months):
- KBLI 1200 (Tobacco - excise licensing)
- KBLI 1313 (Textile finishing - AMDAL)
- KBLI 1511 (Leather tanning - AMDAL)
- KBLI 1621 (Veneer/Panels - AMDAL)
- KBLI 1701 (Pulp/Paper - AMDAL + construction) --- ## COMMON MISTAKES & WARNINGS ### ❌ Mistake #1: Ignoring SVLK for Wood Products
**Problem**: Operating wood manufacturing (KBLI 16xxx) without SVLK (Timber Legality Verification)
**Consequence**:
- Business shutdown
- Criminal prosecution (illegal logging penalties: imprisonment + fines)
- Export ban
- Blacklisting
**Solution**:
- Apply for SVLK **immediately** after NIB issuance
- Ensure all timber sourced has legal verification
- Keep wood sourcing documentation for 5 years ### ❌ Mistake #2: Underestimating Environmental Compliance Costs
**High-Risk KBLIs**:
**Solution**:
- Budget **additional 30-50%** for High (T) risk KBLIs
- Consult environmental engineer **before** site selection
- Include AMDAL costs in initial capital planning ### ❌ Mistake #3: Attempting 100% Foreign Ownership for Tobacco
**Problem**: Applying for KBLI 1200 (Tobacco) with 100% foreign ownership
**Consequence**: NIB application **rejected** by OSS system
**Solution**:
- Partner with Indonesian shareholder (minimum 33%)
- Structure shareholder agreement clearly
- Consider Joint Venture (JV) or nominee structure (risky - see below) ### ❌ Mistake #4: Missing Excise License (NPPBKC) for Tobacco
**Problem**: Setting up tobacco manufacturing without NPPBKC (Excise License)
**Consequence**: Cannot sell products (all tobacco requires excise stamps)
**Timeline Impact**: NPPBKC application takes 6-12 months
**Solution**: Apply for NPPBKC **in parallel** with NIB (not sequentially) ### ❌ Mistake #5: E-commerce Retail Strategy for Textiles/Apparel
**Problem**: Foreign investor plans to manufacture + sell online via e-commerce
**Legal Issue**: PR 49/2021 - Online retail of textiles, apparel, footwear **reserved for SMEs**
**Consequence**: E-commerce platform account blocked, business closed
**Solution**:
- Manufacture (100% foreign) ✅
- Wholesale to distributors (100% foreign) ✅
- Partner with local SME for online retail ✅
- OR focus on export market ✅ ### ❌ Mistake #6: Combining Unrelated KBLI Codes
**Problem**: Combining KBLI 1410 (Apparel) + KBLI 2399 (Non-metallic mineral products) + KBLI 6910 (Legal services)
**Consequence**: OSS rejects application (unrelated business activities raise red flags)
**Solution**:
- Only combine **related** KBLIs (e.g., 1311 textile spinning + 1312 textile weaving + 1313 textile finishing = vertically integrated textile mill)
- Maximum 3-5 KBLI codes recommended ### ❌ Mistake #7: Using KBLI 2017 or 2015 Codes
**Problem**: Applying with outdated KBLI codes (system requires KBLI 2020)
**Consequence**: NIB application rejected
**Solution**:
- Always use **KBLI 2020** codes (5-digit format)
- Check oss.go.id for latest KBLI list
- Some codes were renumbered (e.g., old KBLI 1810 → new KBLI 1701) ### ❌ Mistake #8: Insufficient Paid-Up Capital
**Problem**: Stating IDR 10B investment but only paying IDR 2.5B paid-up capital
**Legal Requirement**: Paid-up capital must be **at least 25%** of total investment plan
**Consequence**: Immigration (work visa KITAS for directors) may reject; BKPM audit issues
**Solution**: Pay minimum IDR 2.5B paid-up capital **before** KITAS application ### ❌ Mistake #9: Ignoring SNI Certification Deadlines
**Problem**: Manufacturing products without mandatory SNI, planning to get SNI "later"
**Consequence**: Cannot sell products domestically; customs blocks exports
**SNI Mandatory for**:
- Textiles (certain fabrics, garments)
- Footwear (safety shoes, children's footwear)
- Wood products (plywood, MDF)
- Paper products (tissue, toilet paper)
**Solution**: Apply for SNI certification **in parallel** with factory setup (testing takes 3-6 months) ### ❌ Mistake #10: Nominee Structure for Tobacco
**Problem**: Using Indonesian "nominee" shareholder (100% foreign control, but 33% nominee on paper)
**Legal Issue**: **ILLEGAL** under Indonesian law (UU 25/2007 Investment Law)
**Consequence**:
- Company dissolution
- Criminal prosecution (fraud)
- Deportation + blacklist for foreign directors
- **0% success rate** in disputes
**Solution**:
- Structure **genuine partnership** with Indonesian shareholder
- Use shareholder agreement (legal) with clear rights/responsibilities
- Consider Put/Call option agreements (legal exit mechanism) --- ## QUICK REFERENCE TABLES ### Table 1: Risk Level Summary | KBLI Code | Description | Risk Level | Timeline | Environmental Permit? |
