## 11. Common Mistakes & Penalties This section highlights **frequent errors** made by business owners (especially foreigners) when navigating Indonesia's licensing system, and the **penalties** for non-compliance. --- ### Common Mistake #1: Operating Without NIB or Expired Licenses **What Happens**:
- Business operates without obtaining NIB
- Or operates with expired licenses (e.g., expired Sertifikat Standar, expired SLF, expired NPPBCK) **Penalty**:
- **Immediate business closure** by local DPMPTSP or Satpol PP (Civil Service Police)
- IDR 100M-500M fine (depends on business size and duration of violation)
- All equipment and inventory may be seized until fine is paid
- **Criminal charges** possible under KUHP Article 263 (falsification) if operated with fake licenses **Real Example**:
- **Operation Wira Waspada (2023)**: 267 companies had licenses revoked, many for operating without valid NIB or failing to renew licenses
- Villa in Canggu (2024): Closed by Satpol PP for operating without NIB, owner fined IDR 150M, villa sealed for 3 months --- ### Common Mistake #2: Incorrect KBLI Code Selection **What Happens**:
- Business registers with wrong KBLI code
- Example: Restaurant (KBLI 56101) also offers villa accommodation but didn't add KBLI 55130
- Or: Consultant (KBLI 70209) also does IT development but didn't add KBLI 62020 **Why It's a Problem**:
- Operating outside registered KBLI codes = illegal business activity
- Risk level may be incorrectly assessed (e.g., bar without alcohol KBLI 56301 ‚Üí missing NPPBCK) **Penalty**:
- Warning + requirement to add correct KBLI codes within 1 month
- If not corrected: Temporary suspension until corrected
- If continued violations: IDR 50M-200M fine + potential NIB revocation **How to Avoid**:
- Carefully read KBLI code descriptions before selecting
- If business has multiple activities, add all relevant KBLI codes
- Consult KBLI guide (see Section 2) or use OSS search function
- When in doubt, ask DPMPTSP or legal consultant --- ### Common Mistake #3: Capital Calculation Errors (PT PMA) **What Happens**:
- Owner thinks "IDR 10B investment" = total for whole company
- **WRONG**: IDR 10B **per KBLI per location** (excludes land/buildings) **Example** (Incorrect Calculation):
- PT PMA owns: - 1 restaurant in Seminyak (KBLI 56101) - 1 bar in Seminyak (KBLI 56301) - 1 villa in Canggu (KBLI 55130)
- Owner thinks: "I need IDR 10B total"
- **CORRECT Calculation**: - Restaurant (56101) in Seminyak: IDR 10B - Bar (56301) in Seminyak: IDR 10B (separate KBLI, even though same location) - Villa (55130) in Canggu: IDR 10B (different location) - **Total required**: IDR 30B **Exception (F&B)**:
- Multiple F&B businesses (restaurants, cafes) in **same regency** (e.g., all in Badung) can share IDR 10B
- But if in different regencies (e.g., 1 in Badung, 1 in Gianyar), each needs IDR 10B **Penalty**:
- OSS application rejected if capital too low
- If already operating: Warning + requirement to increase paid-up capital within 6 months
- If not corrected: License suspension until corrected --- ### Common Mistake #4: Missing LKPM Reporting **What Happens**:
- PT PMA forgets to submit LKPM quarterly report
- Or submits late (after deadline)
- Or submits with incomplete or false data **Penalty** (Progressive):
1. **1st missed deadline**: Warning letter from BKPM (via OSS notification + email)
2. **2nd consecutive missed deadline**: Written warning + grace period (1 month) + potential audit
3. **3rd consecutive missed deadline**: Administrative sanctions: - Temporary suspension of business licenses - Freezing of investment facilities (tax holidays, tax allowances) - Company flagged in BKPM system (can affect future license applications)
4. **Continued non-compliance**: **NIB revocation** + business closure + potential deportation of foreign directors **False Data in LKPM**:
- IDR 100M-500M fine + administrative sanctions
- If intentional fraud (e.g., inflating investment to appear eligible for tax holiday): Criminal charges under KUHP **Real Impact**:
- LKPM non-compliance is **#1 reason for PT PMA license revocation** in Indonesia
- Many PT PMAs fail to realize LKPM is **mandatory every quarter**, not just annually --- ### Common Mistake #5: Selling Alcohol Without NPPBCK **What Happens**:
- Restaurant or bar sells beer, wine, or spirits without obtaining NPPBCK (Alcohol License)
- Owner thinks "I have Sertifikat Standar, that's enough"
- **WRONG**: NPPBCK is separate, mandatory license from Bea Cukai (Customs) **Why It's Serious**:
- Alcohol is **excise good** (barang kena cukai) regulated by Ministry of Finance
- Selling alcohol without NPPBCK = **illegal alcohol trade** = smuggling
- Bea Cukai has enforcement powers (raids, seizures, arrests) **Penalty**:
- IDR 200M-500M fine (or 10x value of alcohol sold, whichever higher)
- Immediate business closure + sealing of premises
- All alcohol inventory seized (not returned)
- **Criminal charges** under Excise Law (UU Cukai): - Prison: 1-5 years - Fine: IDR 100M-1B
- Deportation of foreign directors/shareholders
- **Lifetime ban** from NPPBCK (cannot re-apply) **Real Examples**:
- Bar in Seminyak (2023): Raided by Bea Cukai, found selling spirits without Class C NPPBCK (only had Class A for beer), fined IDR 300M, closed for 6 months, owner deported
- Restaurant chain (2024): 3 locations selling wine without NPPBCK, total fine IDR 800M across all locations, NPPBCK applications permanently rejected **How to Avoid**:
- **Always apply for NPPBCK BEFORE selling any alcohol** (beer, wine, spirits)
- Don't start selling alcohol while NPPBCK application is pending (wait for approval)
- If adding alcohol to existing restaurant: Add KBLI 56301, update Sertifikat Standar, apply for NPPBCK
- Submit monthly NPPBCK reports on time (by 10th of following month) --- ### Common Mistake #6: Operating in Wrong Zone **What Happens**:
- Business operates in location not permitted by zoning regulations (RTRW - Rencana Tata Ruang Wilayah)
- Example: Commercial business (restaurant, bar, shop) in **green zone** (conservation/agricultural) or **yellow zone** (residential) **Zoning Categories in Bali**:
- **Green Zone**: Conservation, agriculture, forestry ‚Üí **No commercial businesses allowed** (except small warungs serving local community)
- **Yellow Zone**: Residential ‚Üí **Limited commercial allowed** (small shops, warungs), **No bars, nightclubs, large restaurants**
- **Orange Zone**: Mixed residential-commercial ‚Üí Most commercial businesses allowed (restaurants, small hotels, villas)
- **Red Zone**: Commercial/tourism ‚Üí All commercial businesses allowed (hotels, bars, nightclubs, malls) **How to Check Zoning**:
1. Visit local DPMPTSP office
2. Provide land certificate (SHM) or address
3. Request **Surat Keterangan Rencana Kabupaten/Kota (SKRK)** - zoning certificate
4. SKRK will state: Zone color, permitted uses, building restrictions (height, setbacks, building coverage ratio) **Penalty**:
- OSS application rejected if location is not permitted for selected KBLI code
- If already operating (e.g., built before checking zoning): **Forced closure** + **Demolition order** (for permanent structures)
- IDR 50M-500M fine (depends on violation severity)
- **No compensation** for demolished structures **Real Examples**:
- Villa in Canggu (2022): Built in green zone (near rice fields), local village (banjar) complained, regency government ordered demolition, owner lost IDR 15B investment (land + construction)
- Beach club in Pererenan (2023): Operated in yellow zone (residential area), neighbors complained about noise, closed by Satpol PP, never reopened --- ### Common Mistake #7: Employing Foreign Workers Without IMTA **What Happens**:
- Company hires foreign worker (TKA) without obtaining RPTKA + IMTA
- Or foreign worker works on tourist visa or business visa (B211A) instead of work visa (KITAS 312) **Why It's Serious**:
- Working on tourist/business visa = **illegal work** = immigration violation
- Indonesia has high unemployment ‚Üí strict enforcement to protect local jobs
- Immigration has detection systems (cross-checks visa types with employment records) **Penalty**:
- **For Foreign Worker**: - Immediate detention by Immigration (can be held 10 days) - Deportation + 5-year ban from Indonesia - Blacklisted in immigration database (difficult to get visa for any ASEAN country)
- **For Employer (Company)**: - IDR 100M-500M fine - Administrative sanctions (license suspension) - **Criminal charges** under Immigration Law: - Prison: 1-5 years for company director - Fine: IDR 500M-1B
- **For Individual (Business Owner Working Illegally)**: - Deportation + lifetime ban - All assets in Indonesia may be frozen/seized **Real Examples**:
- Australian restaurateur in Seminyak (2024): Worked as chef on tourist visa, reported by local competitors, detained by Immigration, deported, 5-year ban, restaurant forced to close
- Russian yoga instructor in Ubud (2023): Taught yoga classes on business visa, raided by Immigration, detained, deported, studio fined IDR 200M **Exceptions (No IMTA Required)**:
- Foreign directors/commissioners with substantial shares (> 10%) ‚Üí Considered **investors**, not workers
- Foreign visitors giving short-term training (< 7 days) under business visa
- Foreign diplomats/consular staff **How to Avoid**:
- **ALWAYS apply for RPTKA + IMTA BEFORE hiring foreign worker**
- Foreign worker must enter Indonesia on **work visa (VITAS 312)** ‚Üí Convert to KITAS 312 upon arrival
- Don't let foreign worker start working while IMTA application is pending (wait for approval)
- For business owners: If you will work actively in business (not just as passive investor/shareholder), you need IMTA --- ### Common Mistake #8: False Information in License Applications **What Happens**:
- Applicant provides false information in NIB, Sertifikat Standar, or other license applications
- Examples: - Inflated investment value (to appear eligible for tax incentives) - False employee count (to avoid BPJS contributions) - Fake diplomas/certificates for technical personnel - False ownership structure (nominee arrangements) **Why It's Serious**:
- Government cross-checks data with: - Tax office (investment, revenue) - BPJS (employee count) - Immigration (foreign worker permits) - Ministry of Law (company ownership)
- Nominee arrangements for PT PMA are **illegal** (foreigners cannot use Indonesian nominees to circumvent foreign ownership restrictions) **Penalty**:
- **Administrative**: - Immediate license revocation - IDR 500M-1B fine - Blacklisted from OSS (cannot re-apply for new NIB)
- **Criminal** (under KUHP Article 263 - Falsification): - Prison: 1-6 years - Fine: IDR 500M-1B
- **For Nominee Arrangements**: - Company dissolution - All assets seized by state - **No compensation** to foreign investor - Foreign investor banned from Indonesia **Real Examples**:
- PT PMA hotel company (2024): Inflated investment from IDR 50B to IDR 100B to qualify for tax holiday, BKPM discovered during audit, tax holiday revoked + IDR 500M fine + director prosecuted
- PT PMA villa company (2023): Used Indonesian nominee to hide 100% foreign ownership (actual ownership 95% foreign, 5% nominee), K3NI investigation found nominee arrangement, company dissolved, foreign investor lost IDR 45B (villa + land), deported --- ### Common Mistake #9: Not Renewing Licenses on Time **What Happens**:
- Business forgets to renew time-limited licenses before expiry: - Sertifikat Standar (MT): 1-3 years - SLF: 5 years - Tourism Business License: 3 years - Health Certificate (F&B): 1 year - Halal Certificate: 4 years - BPOM Registration: 5 years **Why It's a Problem**:
- Operating with **expired license** = operating **without license** = illegal
- Government inspections often happen shortly after license expiry dates (they know when licenses expire) **Penalty**:
- Warning + grace period (1 month) to renew
- If not renewed: Business closure until renewed
- If continued operations with expired license: IDR 50M-200M fine + potential NIB revocation **How to Avoid**:
- Maintain **license expiry calendar** (Excel, Google Calendar, or project management tool)
- Set reminders: - 6 months before expiry: Start renewal process (for complex licenses like BPOM, Halal) - 3 months before expiry: Submit renewal application (for SLF, Tourism License) - 1 month before expiry: Follow up on renewal status
- Assign responsibility to specific person (Operations Manager, Admin Manager) --- ### Common Mistake #10: Poor Record-Keeping **What Happens**:
- Business doesn't maintain required records: - LKPM submission receipts - Tax payment receipts - BPJS payment receipts - Employee contracts - Training records - Maintenance logs (fire extinguishers, building, equipment) - Incident logs
- During government inspection, cannot provide documents **Penalty**:
- Warning + requirement to provide documents within 1 week
- If cannot provide: Assumption of non-compliance ‚Üí Administrative sanctions (license suspension until documents provided)
- Repeat violations: IDR 10M-50M fine + increased inspection frequency (flagged as high-risk) **Best Practices**:
1. **Digital + Physical Filing**: - Keep digital copies (PDF) on Google Drive, Dropbox, or company server (backup to external hard drive) - Keep physical copies in binders (organized by year, category)
2. **Folder Structure**: - Licenses (NIB, Sertifikat Standar, PBG/SLF, NPPBCK, Tourism, Health, Halal) - Tax (PPh, PPN, monthly payment receipts) - BPJS (Kesehatan, Ketenagakerjaan, monthly payment receipts) - LKPM (submission receipts, quarterly) - Employees (contracts, BPJS registrations, training records) - Maintenance (fire extinguisher inspections, building repairs, equipment servicing) - Incidents (accidents, complaints, government inspections, resolutions)
3. **Retention Period**: Keep records for **10 years** (tax records) and **5 years** (other business records) --- ### Penalty Summary Table | Violation | Administrative Penalty | Criminal Penalty |
