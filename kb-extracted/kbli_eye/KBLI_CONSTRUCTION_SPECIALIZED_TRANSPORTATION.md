## 1) Executive Summary - Specialized Construction (43xxx): Generally open, requires construction business certification and professional competency under LPJK/PUPR regimes. Risk level often Medium (MR) to Medium-High (MT). Projects with higher risk or public facilities can be High (T).
- Transportation (49xxx–53xxx): Heavily regulated. Several sub-sectors are subject to foreign ownership limits, cabotage principles (maritime), and safety/operator certification (air). Always verify in OSS RBA for current restrictions.
- Minimum Investment: IDR 10 billion per KBLI per project (PMA), unless explicitly exempted. Paid-up capital typically ≥ IDR 10B for PMA practical acceptance.
- Licensing: NIB via OSS; sector permits per sub-sector (construction standard certificates; route/operator permits for transport; safety/compliance certificates).
- Certification: SBU (Sertifikat Badan Usaha) via LPJK for construction; AOC and related approvals for air; port/harbor and seaworthiness for water; route/vehicle permits for land; SPPL/AMDAL as applicable. ### Quick Summary (Operational)

- Ownership & Risk (first) - Verifica percentuali FO e condizioni in OSS RBA + Perpres 10/2021 (e aggiornamenti). - Annota il Risk Level (R/MR/MT/T) e l’Output di licenza (Sertifikat Standar/Izin).
- Licensing flow standard - Costituzione PT PMA → NIB (OSS) → Sertifikat Standar/Izin → Permessi settoriali → Certificazioni sicurezza/qualità.
- Key requirements per settore - 43xxx Costruzioni: SBU + SKK (LPJK), K3, SLO elettrico dove richiesto, ambiente (SPPL/UKL‑UPL/AMDAL per scala). - 49xxx Terra: licenza operatore, permessi tratta/terminal, idoneità veicoli, conducenti abilitati, SMS. - 50xxx Acqua: cabotaggio per domestico, registrazione/flag, ISM/ISPS, permessi portuali. - 51xxx Aereo: AOC, slot/rotte, SMS/MRO, abilitazioni equipaggi; spesso limiti FO/controllo locale. - 52xxx Magazzini/Supporto: NIB+Sertifikat, dogana (bonded), permessi ambientali, safety; accessi porti/aeroporti. - 53xxx Poste/Corrieri: licenze postali/corrieri, USO (più restrittivo), protezione dati e SLA.
- Timeline & compliance costs (compliance, esclusi asset)
- Common pitfalls da evitare - Assumere 100% FO in trasporti senza OSS; ignorare cabotaggio/manning. - Operare senza SBU/SKK/SLO (costruzioni) o fuori ambito AOC (aereo). - Strumenti ambientali errati (SPPL vs UKL‑UPL vs AMDAL); mancanza di permessi rotta/terminal. - Confondere forwarding (5229x) con trucking (4941x) o warehousing (5210x). ---
