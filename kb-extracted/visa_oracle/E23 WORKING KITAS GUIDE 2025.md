⚠️ IMPORTANT: This document reflects 2025 regulations. The old C312A/C312B visa 
codes were abolished in 2023. If you have outdated information referring to 
"C312", please refer to this E23 guide instead.

Entry Type: Multiple entry (built-in, no separate MERP needed)

The E23 is Indonesia's primary work permit for foreign nationals employed by 
Indonesian companies (PT/PT PMA). Unlike the old system where C312A (manager)
