## üöÄ Implementation Priority

### ‚úÖ Must Have (High ROI)
1. **Corporate tax calculation (PPh 25)**
   - Formula: `revenue < 4.8B ? revenue * 0.005 : profit * 0.22`
   - Impact: Massive savings for small business (22% ‚Üí 0.5%)

2. **VAT (PPN 11%)**
   - Formula: `outputVAT - inputVAT`
   - Impact: Major expense (11% of revenue)

3. **NPWPD for hospitality**
   - Formula: `revenue * 0.10` (Bali only)
   - Impact: 10% of revenue for F&B businesses

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Nice to Have (Medium ROI)
4. **Employee tax (PPh 21)**
   - Complex: PTKP + progressive brackets
   - Impact: Variable per employee

5. **BPJS**
   - Formula: `salary * (0.04 health + 0.0624 employment)`
   - Impact: ~10% of payroll

### ‚ùå Low Priority
6. **PPh 23** (depends on services expenses - variable)
7. **Tax treaty benefits** (complex, case-by-case)

## üîß Integration Steps

```typescript
// OLD (lines 47-52)
private calculateTaxes(intent: any): any {
  return {
    estimated: 'IDR 15,000,000/month',
    breakdown: {}
  };
}

// NEW
private calculateTaxes(intent: TaxIntent): TaxBreakdown {
  // Copy implementation from TAX_CALCULATIONS_EXAMPLES.md
  const pph21 = this.calculatePPh21Total(intent.salaries);
  const pph25 = this.calculatePPh25(intent.revenue);
  const ppn = this.calculatePPN(intent.revenue, intent.inputVAT || 0);
  const npwpd = this.calculateNPWPD(intent.revenue, intent.sector);

  return {
    pph21, pph25, ppn, npwpd, bpjs,
    totalMonthly: pph21 + pph25 + ppn + npwpd + bpjs.total
  };
}
```

### Step 2: Add Tax Rate Constants
```typescript

private taxRates = {
  corporate: {
    standard: 0.22,
    smallBusiness: 0.005, // PP 23/2018
    listed: 0.19
  },
  personal: {
    brackets: [
      { limit: 60000000, rate: 0.05 },
      { limit: 250000000, rate: 0.15 },
      { limit: 500000000, rate: 0.25 },
      { limit: 5000000000, rate: 0.30 },
      { limit: Infinity, rate: 0.35 }
    ]
  },
  vat: 0.11,
  bpjs: {
    health: 0.04,
    employment: 0.0624
  },
  npwpd: {
    hospitality: 0.10
  }
};
```

### Step 3: Test
```typescript
// Use test cases from TAX_CALCULATIONS_EXAMPLES.md
const result = taxGenius.analyze({
  revenue: 500_000_000,
  employees: 5,
  salaries: [8_000_000, 6_000_000, 5_000_000, 4_000_000, 4_000_000],
  companyType: 'PT_PMA',
