- Minimum order quantities (e.g., 1 carton, 1 pallet, 100 units) **Exception with Partnership Requirement**:
- **KBLI 46206** (Distribution of fishery products): Requires partnership with Indonesian micro, small, or medium enterprise (SME) --- ### Retail Trade (47xxx) - CLOSED to Foreigners **Description**:
- Selling goods to end consumers (general public) in small quantities (B2C)
- Includes: Shops, stores, boutiques, online retail (individual items) **Examples**:
- **47111**: Retail sale in non-specialized stores (supermarkets, convenience stores)
- **47711**: Retail sale of clothing in specialized stores
- **47911**: Retail sale via mail order or Internet (e-commerce)
- **47912**: Retail sale via stalls and markets **Foreign Ownership**: **CLOSED** (0%) - Reserved for Indonesian citizens and local companies **Why Closed**:
- Protect small businesses (warungs, toko, UKM)
- Preserve traditional markets
- Employment for local communities **Alternative for Foreign Investors**:
- **Cannot** operate retail stores directly
- **Can** invest in: - **Wholesale** (KBLI 46xxx) and sell to local retailers - **E-commerce platforms** (KBLI 63122 or 47919 - see Section 12) - **Manufacturing** (KBLI 10xxx-33xxx) and distribute via local retailers --- ### Key Differences: Retail vs Wholesale | Aspect | Retail (47xxx) | Wholesale (46xxx) |

| **Location** | Shops, stores, malls, online | Warehouses, distribution centers |
| **Pricing** | Retail price (higher) | Wholesale price (lower, volume discount) |
| **Foreign Ownership** | ❌ CLOSED (0%) | ✅ OPEN (100%) |
| **License** | N/A (closed) | NIB + Sertifikat Standar | --- ### Common Mistakes **Mistake #1**: Attempting to operate retail store as foreign-owned PT PMA
- ❌ Register PT PMA with KBLI 47111 (supermarket) → Application rejected by OSS
- ✅ Solution: Partner with Indonesian citizen (nominee arrangements are illegal, but legal local partnership with profit-sharing is allowed) **Mistake #2**: Wholesale company selling small quantities to individuals
- ❌ Wholesaler (KBLI 46xxx) sells 1 bottle of oil to individual customer → Considered retail, violates KBLI code
- ⚠️ Penalty: Warning, potential reclassification to retail (then forced closure if foreign-owned)
- ✅ Solution: Enforce minimum order quantities (e.g., "Minimum order: 1 carton = 12 bottles") **Mistake #3**: E-commerce confusion
- ❌ Foreign PT PMA tries to operate online retail (KBLI 47911) → CLOSED
- ✅ Solution: Use KBLI 47919 (e-commerce retail - exception) or KBLI 63122 (e-commerce platform) - see Section 12 --- <a name="e-commerce"></a>
