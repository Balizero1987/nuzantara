- Same operational area (can be interpreted as same province or same business model) **Result**: Potential cost savings , timeline reduction 1-2 months --- ## 2. Construction & Real Estate Cases ### Case 2.1: Residential Construction Business **Client Profile**:
- Name: BuildCo (Australian company)
- Business: Residential villa construction in Bali
- Intent: Build villas for clients

``` **Compliance Obligations**:
- **LKPM Reporting**: Quarterly (every 3 months) - ‚ö†Ô∏è 3 missed reports = LICENSE REVOKED - Report: Investment realization, projects completed, employment
- **Standards Compliance**: - Quality standards for materials/equipment - Safety and health at work (K3) - Environmental management per project **Client Warning**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Foreign ownership limit 67%**: Must have Indonesian partner with 33% equity. Consider:
- Joint venture agreement with clear decision-making rights
- Shareholder agreement protecting foreign investor interests
- Exit strategy if partnership fails --- ### Case 2.2: Property Management Business **Client Profile**:
- Name: PropManage Asia (US company)
- Business: Villa rental management (manage properties for owners)
- Intent: Fee-based property management (10-20% commission) **Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 68200**: Fee-Based or Contractual Real Estate **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Property management services
KBLI count: 1 (68200)
Location count: 1 (Bali) Capital Calculation: Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED Risk Level: Low (L)
- NIB only (no additional licenses required)
- Processing: Instant Business Model:
- Manage villas/properties owned by OTHERS
- Services: Marketing, booking, maintenance, guest services
- Revenue: Commission-based (10-20% of rental income) Required "Licenses":
1. NIB - Instant ‚úÖ
2. Business License - Instant (Low risk auto-approval)
3. No sectoral license required ‚úÖ Optional (recommended):
- Professional liability insurance
- Service contracts with property owners
- Booking system (online platform) Total Timeline: 1-2 weeks (company setup + NIB)
``` **Key Distinction**:
- **KBLI 68200** (Property Management): Manage properties for OTHERS (fee-based) ‚úÖ 100% foreign
- **KBLI 68111** (Real Estate Rental): Own and rent properties yourself ‚úÖ 100% foreign
- **KBLI 41011** (Construction): Build properties ‚ö†Ô∏è 67% foreign only **Why This Works**:
‚úÖ Low risk = minimal licensing requirements
‚úÖ 100% foreign ownership allowed
‚úÖ Fast setup (1-2 weeks vs 3-4 months for construction) --- ## 3. IT & Technology Cases ### Case 3.1: Software Development Company **Client Profile**:
- Name: DevStudio (Indian tech company)
- Business: Custom software development for Indonesian clients
- Services: Web apps, mobile apps, SaaS products
- Team: 10 developers (5 foreign, 5 Indonesian) **Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 62010**: Computer Programming Services **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Software development
KBLI count: 1 (62010)

2. Business License - Instant (Low risk)
3. No sectoral license required ‚úÖ Foreign Worker Requirements (5 foreign developers):
- RPTKA (Work Permit Plan) per foreign worker Total Timeline: 2-3 months (company setup + work permits)
``` **Operating Costs (Annual)**:
```
Fixed Costs:
- LKPM reporting: Free (online, quarterly) Salaries (estimated): ``` **Business Model Validation**:
‚úÖ Low licensing requirements (NIB only)
‚úÖ 100% foreign ownership
‚úÖ Fast setup (2-3 months including work permits)
‚ö†Ô∏è High operating costs (salaries + office + worker contributions) **Client Recommendation**:
Consider **remote work model** (developers work from home country) to:
- Reduce office rent (small Jakarta office for client meetings only)
- Simplify work permits (only 1-2 foreign managers need KITAS) --- ### Case 3.2: IT Consulting + Software Production **Client Profile**:
- Name: TechConsult Global (Singapore)
- Business: IT consulting + custom software production
- Services: IT strategy, system architecture, software development **Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 62020**: Computer Consultancy
- **KBLI 58200**: Software Production **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: IT consulting + software development
KBLI count: 2 (62020 + 58200)

‚úÖ **Related activities**: Consulting often leads to software development projects
‚úÖ **Integrated operations**: Same team, same office, complementary services
‚úÖ **Common in tech industry**: Many IT companies do both consulting + development **Capital Allocation**:
``` How to allocate in practice:
``` --- ## 4. Retail vs Wholesale Cases ### Case 4.1: WRONG - Retail Store Attempt **Client Profile**:
- Name: FashionCo (French company)
- Business: Clothing retail store in Bali
- Intent: Sell imported fashion brands **WRONG KBLI Selection**:
- ‚ùå **KBLI 47xxx**: Retail Trade (ANY code starting with 47) **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Retail clothing store (offline)
KBLI attempted: 47xxx (any retail code) Result: ‚ùå APPLICATION REJECTED Reason: ALL offline retail trade (47xxx) is CLOSED to foreign investment Foreign Ownership: 0% ‚ö†Ô∏è PROHIBITED
``` **OSS System Response**:
```
ERROR: KBLI 47xxx is not available for foreign investment (PT PMA).
This business line is closed to foreign ownership per Presidential Regulation 10/2021. Recommendation:
1. Change business model to wholesale (46xxx) - 100% foreign allowed
2. Change business model to e-commerce (47919) - 100% foreign allowed with conditions
3. Partner with Indonesian citizen (99% local / 1% nominee - NOT RECOMMENDED)
4. Register as CV/local business (requires Indonesian citizen as legal owner)
``` **What Client Should Do Instead**:
See Case 4.2 or 4.3 below --- ### Case 4.2: CORRECT - Wholesale + E-commerce Model **Client Profile**:
- Name: FashionCo (French company) - same client as Case 4.1
- Business: Import & distribute fashion brands (revised model)
- Intent: Wholesale to retailers + e-commerce platform **Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 46420**: Wholesale of Clothing
- **KBLI 47919**: Retail Trade via E-commerce **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Wholesale distribution + e-commerce
KBLI count: 2
Location count: 1 (Bali/Jakarta warehouse) Capital Calculation for KBLI 46420 (Wholesale):
- Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED Capital Calculation for KBLI 47919 (E-commerce): Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED (both codes, no local partner needed) Risk Level:
- KBLI 46420 (Wholesale): Low (L)
- KBLI 47919 (E-commerce): Low (L) Required Licenses:
1. NIB - Instant
2. Business License - Instant (Low risk both codes)
3. API-U (General Import License) - if importing directly
4. No retail store license needed (online only) ‚úÖ Total Timeline: 1-2 weeks
``` **Business Model**:
```
Revenue Stream 1: Wholesale (B2B)
- Sell to Indonesian retailers (batik shops, boutiques, malls)
- Minimum order quantities (MOQ)
- Payment terms: Net 30-60 days
- Margins: 30-50% Revenue Stream 2: E-commerce (B2C)
- Sell directly to consumers via website/app
- Platforms: Own website, Tokopedia, Shopee, Lazada
- Payment: Credit card, e-wallet, bank transfer
- Margins: 50-100% (retail price) Warehouse/Office:
- Jakarta or Bali (choose one)
- Size: 500-1000m¬≤ for inventory
- Staff: 10-20 (operations, customer service, logistics)
``` **Key Distinctions**:
- **KBLI 46420**: Sell to OTHER BUSINESSES (retailers) - wholesale ‚úÖ
- **KBLI 47919**: Sell to END CONSUMERS via ONLINE platform - e-commerce ‚úÖ
- ‚ùå **CANNOT have physical retail store** (47xxx offline = closed)
- ‚úÖ **CAN have showroom** (for wholesale buyers only, not public walk-in) Presidential Regulation 10/2021 states: **Client's Choice**: --- ### Case 4.3: CORRECT - Wholesale Only Model **Client Profile**:
- Name: FashionCo (French company) - if lower budget
- Business: Import & distribute fashion brands (wholesale only)
- Intent: Wholesale to retailers only (no e-commerce) **Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 46420**: Wholesale of Clothing **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Wholesale distribution only
KBLI count: 1
Location count: 1 Capital Calculation: Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED Risk Level: Low (L) Total Timeline: 1 week
``` **Why This Works**:
‚úÖ 100% foreign ownership
‚úÖ Fast setup
‚úÖ No complex e-commerce platform needed
‚ùå Cannot sell directly to consumers (B2B only) --- ## 5. Multi-Location Business Cases ### Case 5.1: Coffee Shop Chain **Client Profile**:
- Name: BeanCo (Canadian company)
- Business: Coffee shop chain
- Locations: 5 shops (3 in Bali, 1 in Jakarta, 1 in Yogyakarta) **Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 56101**: Restaurant (coffee shop classified as restaurant) **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: F&B chain (coffee shops)
KBLI count: 1 (56101)
Location count: 5 Capital Calculation: Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED Risk Level: Medium (M) Per-Location Requirements (√ó5):
1. Environmental Permit: SPPL (small coffee shop) 2. Halal Certification (MANDATORY by Oct 17, 2026) Option A: One certificate for all 5 locations (same menu) 3. Health Certificate per location 4. Building Permits (PBG) per location 5. SLF per location (MANDATORY before opening) 6. TDUP (if tourist-focused, especially Bali locations) Total Timeline: 3-4 months for all 5 locations
``` **Strategic Planning**:
```
Launch Strategy:
Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Setup 3 Bali locations (parallel processing)
- Canggu (flagship)
- Seminyak
- Ubud Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Setup Jakarta + Yogyakarta
- Once Bali operations proven Rationale:
- Bali has same local regulations (can use same consultant)
- Test business model in Bali first (tourist market)
- Expand to Jakarta/Yogya after product-market fit PP 28/2025 Benefit:
‚úÖ Single environmental approval MAY cover all locations if:
- Same company
- Same menu/operations
- Same business model
(Check with environmental consultant - this is new regulation)
``` **F&B Specific Notes**:
- **Halal certification**: Get ONE certificate for all locations (same menu)
- **Health certificates**: Must be separate per location (local health dept)
- **Menu consistency**: Keep same menu across all locations for easier licensing --- ### Case 5.2: Real Estate Development (Multi-Project) **Client Profile**:
- Name: DevGroup (Hong Kong company)
- Business: Residential real estate development
- Projects: 3 villa developments (10 villas each = 30 villas total)
- Locations: Canggu, Ubud, Sanur (all Bali) **WRONG Approach**:
```
‚ùå MISTAKE: Selecting KBLI 68111 (Real Estate Owned or Leased) Why wrong?
- KBLI 68111 is for RENTING properties you own
- NOT for BUILDING then SELLING properties
``` **Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 41011**: Residential Building Construction
- **KBLI 68111**: Real Estate Owned or Leased (if some villas will be rented) **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Real estate development (build & sell)
KBLI count: 2 (41011 construction + 68111 rental for unsold inventory)
Location count: 3 (Canggu, Ubud, Sanur) Capital Calculation:
- PLUS: Construction costs (land + building) Foreign Ownership: 67% MAX for KBLI 41011 (construction)
- Need 33% Indonesian partner
- If Hong Kong counts as "special agreement": Check eligibility PT PMA Structure: Risk Level: High (H) for construction Required Licenses:
1. NIB - Instant
2. Business License - 5-10 days
3. IUJK (Construction License) - 2-4 weeks
4. SBU Grade B (Large construction) - 4-6 weeks
5. LPJK Registration - 2-3 weeks Per-Project Requirements (√ó3 developments):
1. Environmental Permit: AMDAL (10 villas = large development) 2. PBG (Building Permit) per villa: 3. SLF per villa (MANDATORY before sale): 4. IMB (Building Construction Permit) per location: 5. Land Certificates (HGB for PT PMA): - Must convert to HGB (30+30+20 years max) Total Timeline: 6-12 months (AMDAL is bottleneck)
Construction Timeline: +12-18 months per development
Total Project Timeline: 24-30 months (2-2.5 years)
``` **Business Model Reality Check**:
```
Revenue: ROI: 79%-126%
Timeline: 2.5-3 years Risk Factors:
‚ö†Ô∏è AMDAL approval (can be rejected or delayed)
‚ö†Ô∏è Environmental objections from community
‚ö†Ô∏è Sales risk (villas may not sell quickly in Bali market saturation)
‚ö†Ô∏è Foreign ownership 67% limit (partner dispute risk)
‚ö†Ô∏è Nominee buyer risks (foreigners cannot own freehold)
``` **Client Recommendation**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **High complexity**: This is a major real estate development project
‚úÖ **Consider hiring**: Indonesian partner (33%) with construction experience
‚úÖ **Alternative**: Start with 1 development (10 villas) first, then expand
‚úÖ **Risk mitigation**: Pre-sell villas before construction (50% deposit model common in Bali) --- ## 6. Multi-KBLI Business Cases ### Case 6.1: Co-working Space + Caf√© **Client Profile**:
- Name: WorkHub (Singapore)
- Business: Co-working space with caf√©
- Location: Canggu, Bali **Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 68110**: Owned or Rental Real Estate (for co-working space)
- **KBLI 56101**: Restaurant (for caf√©) **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Co-working + F&B
KBLI count: 2
Location count: 1 (Canggu) Capital Calculation: Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED (both codes) Risk Level:
- KBLI 68110: Low (L)
- KBLI 56101: Medium (M)
- Overall: Medium (M) Business Justification:
‚úÖ RELATED activities: Co-working members use caf√©
‚úÖ INTEGRATED operations: Same building, same staff, complementary services
‚úÖ COMMON business model: Many co-working spaces have F&B Required Licenses:
1. NIB - Instant
2. Business License - 3-5 days For Co-working Space (KBLI 68110):
3. Building Permit (PBG)
4. SLF (MANDATORY)
5. Fire Safety Certificate
6. Environmental Permit: SPPL For Caf√© (KBLI 56101):
7. Health Certificate
8. Halal Certification (by Oct 2026)
9. Environmental Permit: SPPL (separate from co-working) Total Timeline: 2-3 months
``` **Revenue Model**:
```
Co-working Revenue: Caf√© Revenue: Operating Costs: Payback Period: 18-24 months
``` **Why This Works**:
‚úÖ Related business activities (approved under PP 28/2025)
‚úÖ 100% foreign ownership both codes
‚úÖ Strong revenue model (2 income streams)
‚úÖ Canggu market demand (digital nomads + tourists) --- ### Case 6.2: WRONG - Unrelated KBLI Combination **Client Profile**:
- Name: GlobalGroup (UK company)
- Business: Multiple unrelated businesses
- Intent: Mining + Education + Travel Agency **WRONG KBLI Selection**:
- ‚ùå KBLI 05xxx: Mining
- ‚ùå KBLI 85321: Higher Education
- ‚ùå KBLI 79111: Travel Agency **Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Multiple unrelated industries
KBLI count: 3
Location count: 1 Capital Calculation: Result: ‚ùå APPLICATION LIKELY REJECTED Reason: Unrelated business activities with NO justification OSS System Response:
"Business activities are not related or integrated. Please provide:
1. Business justification for combining these sectors
2. How operations are integrated
3. Shared resources or synergies If no justification: Register separate PT PMA for each business line."
``` **Why This Fails**:
‚ùå **Mining + Education**: No logical connection
‚ùå **Education + Travel**: Weak connection (student tours?)
‚ùå **Mining + Travel**: No connection at all
‚ùå **Regulatory conflicts**: Each sector has different ministries, regulations, compliance **What Would Be Accepted**:
‚úÖ **Mining + Environmental Services**: Related (mine rehabilitation)
‚úÖ **Education + Consulting**: Related (training programs)
‚úÖ **Travel Agency + Hotel**: Related (tourism industry) **Client Recommendation**:
Create 3 separate PT PMA companies:
- PT Mining Indonesia (KBLI 05xxx)
- PT Education Global (KBLI 85321)
- PT Travel Solutions (KBLI 79111) --- ## 7. Common Mistake Scenarios ### Mistake 7.1: Using KBLI 2017 Instead of KBLI 2020 **Client Scenario**:
- Client uses old consultant's KBLI list from 2017
- Selects KBLI 47111 (Retail Sale in Non-Specialized Stores) from 2017 list **What Happens**:
```
OSS System Response:
‚ùå ERROR: KBLI code 47111 not found in KBLI 2020 database Action Required:
1. Verify KBLI code on official OSS portal: oss.go.id/informasi/kbli-berbasis-risiko
2. Use KBLI 2020 codes only (issued September 24, 2020)
3. Re-submit application with correct code Result: Application REJECTED, must restart
Time Lost: 1-2 weeks
``` **Correct Action**:
Always verify KBLI codes on official OSS portal (oss.go.id) before submission **How to Spot Outdated Codes**:
- KBLI 2020 has 1,417 codes (KBLI 2017 had fewer)
- 216 NEW codes added in 2020 (YouTubers, digital platforms, etc.)
- If code not found on OSS portal ‚Üí outdated --- ### Mistake 7.2: Misunderstanding Capital "Per KBLI Per Location" **Client Scenario**:
- Client wants restaurant + bar in 2 locations (Seminyak + Ubud) **Client's Wrong Calculation**:
```
``` **Correct Calculation**:
```
KBLI count: 2 (restaurant + bar)
Location count: 2 (Seminyak + Ubud) Breakdown:
``` ```
OSS System Response:
‚ùå ERROR: Minimum investment requirement not met Action Required:
1. Increase paid-up capital to minimum IDR 40B, OR
2. Reduce KBLI codes (e.g., restaurant only, no bar), OR
3. Reduce locations (e.g., Seminyak only, not Ubud) Result: Application REJECTED
``` **Client's Options**:
```
``` --- ### Mistake 7.3: Nominee Structure for Land Ownership **Client Scenario**:
- Foreign client wants to buy villa in Bali
- Consultant suggests: "Use Indonesian friend's name, you give them money, they hold title" **This is ILLEGAL and WILL FAIL**:
```
Legal Reality:
- UUPA Article 21: Foreigners CANNOT own freehold land (Hak Milik)
- Nominee arrangement: ILLEGAL under Indonesian law
- Supreme Court precedent: MA 3020 K/Pdt/2014 Result: 0 out of 140 cases won by foreigners (100% loss rate) What Happens:
2. Title in nominee's name (Hak Milik)
3. Nominee disappears / refuses to transfer / sells to someone else
4. Foreigner sues in court
5. Court rules: Agreement is VOID (illegal from the start)
6. Foreigner loses: Money NOT returned, villa NOT transferred Enforcement (2023 Data):
- 185 land certificates REVOKED (nominee structures discovered)
- 163 foreigners DEPORTED
``` **Legal Options for Foreigners**:
```
Option 1: Hak Pakai (Right to Use)
- Duration: 25 years + 20 year extension = 45 years max
- Ownership: Your name on certificate
- Can sell/lease/inherit (with restrictions)
- ‚úÖ LEGAL ‚úÖ SAFE Option 2: Leasehold (Sewa)
- Duration: 25-30 years (renewable)
- Not ownership, just long-term lease
- Lower upfront cost
- Can extend before expiry
- ‚úÖ LEGAL ‚úÖ SAFE Option 3: PT PMA (for commercial property)
- Company owns land (HGB - Right to Build)
- Duration: 30+30+20 years = 80 years max
- You own company (67-100% shares depending on KBLI)
- For business purposes only (villa rental, hotel, etc.)
- ‚úÖ LEGAL ‚úÖ SAFE (if operating business) Option 4: Marriage to Indonesian Citizen
- Spouse can own Hak Milik (freehold)
- Requires prenup or postnup agreement (separate property)
- Constitutional Court 69/PUU-XIII/2015: Postnup is legal
- Risk: Divorce = lose property (unless protected by agreement)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL but RISKY
``` **What Consultant Should Say**:
‚ùå "Use nominee, it's common, everyone does it"
‚úÖ "Nominee is illegal. Here are 4 legal options with pros/cons of each." **Case Example - Julian Petroulas (2024)**:
- Australian property consultant in Bali
- Promoted leasehold properties to foreigners
- Misrepresented leaseholds as "ownership"
- Result: BANNED from Indonesia (November 21, 2024)
- Reason: Misleading foreigners, contributing to illegal land transactions **Bottom Line**:
üö´ **NEVER use nominee structure**
‚úÖ **ALWAYS use legal ownership structure (Hak Pakai, Leasehold, PT PMA)** --- ### Mistake 7.4: Not Getting SLF Before Opening Business **Client Scenario**:
- Client opens restaurant before obtaining SLF (Building Function Certificate)
- Thinks: "I have business license (NIB), I can open" **What Happens**:
```
Day 1: Restaurant opens without SLF
Day 3: Government inspection (random or complaint-triggered)
Day 4: BUSINESS SEALED by local government (Satpol PP) Penalty:
- Business closure until SLF obtained
- Revenue loss: 2-4 weeks (SLF processing time)
- Reputation damage SLF Requirements:
1. Building architecture inspection
2. Building structure inspection
3. Fire safety inspection
4. Utilities inspection (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
5. Accessibility inspection (disabled access) Processing: 7-14 days
Validity: 5 years (renewable)
``` **Correct Sequence**:
```
1. Obtain PBG (Building Permit) - BEFORE construction/renovation
2. Complete construction/renovation
3. Obtain SLF (Building Function Certificate) - BEFORE opening
4. THEN open business to public Timeline:
PBG: 14-30 days
Construction: 2-6 months (depending on scale)
SLF: 7-14 days after construction complete
TOTAL: 3-7 months (cannot skip steps)
``` **Why This Matters**:
- SLF proves building is SAFE for public use
- Required by law (PP 16/2021 on Building Permits)
- No SLF = no operating license validity
- Insurance companies may refuse claims without valid SLF --- ## 8. Capital Calculation Exercises ### Exercise 8.1: Villa Rental Business **Given**:

Despite minority shareholding, foreign investor can have control through: 1. Management Agreement: - Foreign company provides management services - Management fee: 5-10% of revenue - Effective operational control 2. Technology License: - Foreign company licenses technology/systems - Technology fee: 3-5% of revenue - Control of core business systems 3. Franchise Agreement: - Brand/systems licensed from foreign company - Franchise fee: 5-8% of revenue - Quality control provisions 4. Shareholder Agreement: - Veto rights on major decisions (despite 49% shareholding) - Requirement: 80% vote for major decisions - Protects minority shareholder Total Effective Control:
