- **Cannot** combine under one entity --- ### **4. Coworking = Real Estate Code**

- Sell to other businesses (B2B)
- Sell in bulk/wholesale quantities
- NOT direct to end consumers (B2C) **Example**: Cannot retail clothes? Wholesale them instead (46xxx). --- ## üìû VERIFICATION RESOURCES ### **Official OSS Portal**
