## 1. OVERSTAY VIOLATIONS & PENALTIES

### 1.1 Overstay Fine Structure (2025)

**Standard Fine Rate**:
- **IDR 1,000,000 per day** (approximately USD 65/day)
- **Payment Method**: Cash ONLY in Indonesian Rupiah at airport
- **Trigger**: Even one day delay triggers full payment requirement
- **Enforcement**: Digital and biometric tracking systems ensure no exit without payment

### 1.2 Overstay Categories & Consequences

#### Category 1: Short Overstay (1-60 days)
- **Penalty**: IDR 1,000,000 per day fine
- **Process**: Pay at immigration counter at airport before departure
- **No deportation**: You may leave voluntarily after paying fine
- **Administrative Violation**: Not a criminal offense (unless combined with other violations)

**Example Cost Calculations**:
- 7 days overstay = IDR 7,000,000 (USD 455)
- 30 days overstay = IDR 30,000,000 (USD 1,950)
- 60 days overstay = IDR 60,000,000 (USD 3,900)

#### Category 2: Extended Overstay (61+ days)
- **NO FINE**: Deportation mandatory
- **Deportation Cost**: You must pay for your own deportation flight
- **Re-entry Ban**: 6 months to 2 years blacklist
- **Detention**: Held at immigration detention center (IDC) pending deportation
- **Detention Duration**: Immigration offices hold for ~1 week; longer stays moved to IDC

### 1.3 Additional Consequences

**Immigration Blacklist (Cekal)**:
- Overstay 61+ days → Automatic blacklist entry
- Duration: 6 months to 2 years depending on severity
- UU 63/2024: Repeat offenders face up to 10-year re-entry ban

**Criminal Charges**:
- If working illegally on tourist visa during overstay → Criminal prosecution possible
- Combination of violations significantly increases penalties

**Employer Liability**:

- Automated alerts to immigration authorities

**Zero Tolerance Policy**:

**Emergency Extensions**:
- May be available during natural disasters, medical emergencies, or pandemics

- No guarantee of approval - case-by-case basis

**COVID-19 Precedent**:
- During 2020-2021 pandemic, Indonesia offered emergency visa extensions

## 2. BPJS HEALTH INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS

### 2.4 Registration Process

**BPJS Kesehatan Registration**:

**Step 1: Location**
- Register at BPJS office in your city/province
- Bali Example: BPJS office in Denpasar (opposite Immigration Office)
- **Cannot use agents** - must register in person

**Step 2: Required Documents**
- Valid KITAS (minimum 6 months validity remaining)
- Passport
- NPWP (tax number) - if available
- Proof of address in Indonesia (rental contract, utility bill)
- Sponsor letter (from employer or guarantor)

**Step 3: Coverage Selection**
- Class I: IDR 150,000/month (best hospitals, private rooms)
- Class II: IDR 100,000/month (mid-tier facilities, semi-private rooms)
- Class III: IDR 35,000/month (basic public facilities, shared wards)

**Step 4: Payment**
- Must pay monthly in advance
- Payment via bank transfer, convenience stores (Alfamart/Indomaret), or mobile banking
- **CRITICAL**: Payment must never lapse - unpaid months block KITAS extension

**Step 5: BPJS Card**

- Digital BPJS app available: Mobile JKN

### 2.5 BPJS Compliance for KITAS Extension

**Extension Requirements (2025)**:
- Immigration REQUIRES proof of BPJS payment history when extending KITAS
- Must show ALL months paid without gaps
- Unpaid BPJS = **Automatic KITAS extension rejection**

**Documentation Needed**:
- BPJS card
- Payment receipts for all months since KITAS issuance
- BPJS payment history printout (from BPJS office or Mobile JKN app)

### 2.6 BPJS for PT PMA Companies (2025 Enforcement)

**Employer Obligations**:

### 2.7 BPJS vs Private Insurance

**Can You Use Private Insurance Instead?**
- **NO** - BPJS is mandatory regardless of private insurance
- Foreign workers typically maintain BOTH:
  - BPJS Kesehatan (mandatory for KITAS)
  - Private international health insurance (for better care, evacuation coverage)

**Practical Approach**:
- Use BPJS for minor ailments, check-ups (free/low-cost)
- Use private insurance for serious conditions, international hospitals, evacuation

## 3. NIB & OSS SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### 3.1 NIB Overview

**NIB (Nomor Induk Berusaha)** = Business Identification Number

**Legal Basis**:
- Presidential Regulation No. 91/2017
- Effective: May 2018
- Replaces TDP (Company Registration Certificate)

**Purpose**:
- Single identification number for ALL business licensing
- Integrates tax, immigration, manpower, and sectoral permits
- Required for PT PMA companies hiring foreign workers

### 3.2 OSS System (Online Single Submission)

**OSS RBA (Risk-Based Approach)** - 2025 Version

**Key Features**:
- Fully digital business licensing platform
- Real-time processing and notifications
- Integration with multiple government systems:
  - Coretax (automatic NPWP registration)
  - AHU (Ministry of Law - deed verification)
  - Immigration (VITAS/KITAS processing)
  - Manpower (RPTKA work permit approvals)

**Processing Time**:
- Low-risk businesses: NIB issued within **48 hours**
- Medium-risk: 3-5 business days
- High-risk: 7-14 business days (requires additional sectoral approvals)

### 3.3 NIB Integration with Work Permits

**Work Permit Flow (2025)**:

```
Step 1: Company obtains NIB via OSS
         ↓
Step 2: Apply for RPTKA (Foreign Worker Plan) via OSS
         - NIB required as prerequisite
         - Specify foreign worker details, role, duration
         ↓
Step 3: RPTKA approval (HPK RPTKA → Pengesahan RPTKA)
         ↓
Step 4: Apply for VITAS (visa approval) via eVisa system
         - RPTKA approval number required
         - NIB referenced in application
         ↓
Step 5: Foreign worker obtains visa at embassy
         ↓
Step 6: Convert to KITAS in Indonesia
         - RPTKA + NIB documents required
         ↓
Step 7: Apply for IMTA (work permit notification)
         - Issued automatically after KITAS approval
```
