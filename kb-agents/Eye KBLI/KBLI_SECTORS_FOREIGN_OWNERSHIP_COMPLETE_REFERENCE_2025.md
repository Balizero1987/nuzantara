## 11. Retail vs Wholesale (46xxx vs 47xxx)

### Critical Distinction

**Wholesale (46xxx)**: ✅ **OPEN** to foreign investment (100%)
**Retail (47xxx)**: ❌ **CLOSED** to foreign investment (reserved for local businesses)

---

### Wholesale Trade (46xxx) - OPEN to Foreigners

**Description**:
- Buying goods in large quantities from manufacturers/producers and reselling to retailers, other wholesalers, or businesses (B2B)
- **Does NOT sell to end consumers** (general public)

**Examples**:
- **46101**: Commission agents (general merchandise)
- **46321**: Wholesale of meat and meat products
- **46611**: Wholesale of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels
- **46900**: Non-specialized wholesale trade

**Foreign Ownership**: 100%

**Investment**: IDR 10 billion minimum per KBLI per location (excludes land/buildings)

**Risk Level**: Low (R) to Medium-Low (MR)

**Licensing Requirements**:
1. NIB via OSS
2. Sertifikat Standar (MR for most wholesale activities)
3. Warehouse/storage facility (own or lease)
4. Import license (API-U or API-P) if importing goods

**Operational Requirements**:
- Sell in bulk quantities (not single items)
- Customers are businesses, not individuals
- Invoice/receipt issued for B2B transactions (not cash register receipts)
- Minimum order quantities (e.g., 1 carton, 1 pallet, 100 units)

**Exception with Partnership Requirement**:
- **KBLI 46206** (Distribution of fishery products): Requires partnership with Indonesian micro, small, or medium enterprise (SME)

---

### Retail Trade (47xxx) - CLOSED to Foreigners

**Description**:
- Selling goods to end consumers (general public) in small quantities (B2C)
- Includes: Shops, stores, boutiques, online retail (individual items)

**Examples**:
- **47111**: Retail sale in non-specialized stores (supermarkets, convenience stores)
- **47711**: Retail sale of clothing in specialized stores
- **47911**: Retail sale via mail order or Internet (e-commerce)
- **47912**: Retail sale via stalls and markets

**Foreign Ownership**: **CLOSED** (0%) - Reserved for Indonesian citizens and local companies

**Why Closed**:
- Protect small businesses (warungs, toko, UKM)
- Preserve traditional markets
- Employment for local communities

**Alternative for Foreign Investors**:
- **Cannot** operate retail stores directly
- **Can** invest in:
  - **Wholesale** (KBLI 46xxx) and sell to local retailers
  - **E-commerce platforms** (KBLI 63122 or 47919 - see Section 12)
  - **Manufacturing** (KBLI 10xxx-33xxx) and distribute via local retailers

---

### Key Differences: Retail vs Wholesale

| Aspect | Retail (47xxx) | Wholesale (46xxx) |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Customer** | End consumers (individuals) | Businesses (B2B) |
| **Quantity** | Small (1 item, 1 pack) | Bulk (cartons, pallets, 100+ units) |
| **Location** | Shops, stores, malls, online | Warehouses, distribution centers |
| **Pricing** | Retail price (higher) | Wholesale price (lower, volume discount) |
| **Foreign Ownership** | ❌ CLOSED (0%) | ✅ OPEN (100%) |
| **Investment** | N/A (closed) | IDR 10B minimum |
| **License** | N/A (closed) | NIB + Sertifikat Standar |

---

### Common Mistakes

**Mistake #1**: Attempting to operate retail store as foreign-owned PT PMA
- ❌ Register PT PMA with KBLI 47111 (supermarket) → Application rejected by OSS
- ✅ Solution: Partner with Indonesian citizen (nominee arrangements are illegal, but legal local partnership with profit-sharing is allowed)

**Mistake #2**: Wholesale company selling small quantities to individuals
- ❌ Wholesaler (KBLI 46xxx) sells 1 bottle of oil to individual customer → Considered retail, violates KBLI code
- ⚠️ Penalty: Warning, potential reclassification to retail (then forced closure if foreign-owned)
- ✅ Solution: Enforce minimum order quantities (e.g., "Minimum order: 1 carton = 12 bottles")

**Mistake #3**: E-commerce confusion
- ❌ Foreign PT PMA tries to operate online retail (KBLI 47911) → CLOSED
- ✅ Solution: Use KBLI 47919 (e-commerce retail - exception) or KBLI 63122 (e-commerce platform) - see Section 12
