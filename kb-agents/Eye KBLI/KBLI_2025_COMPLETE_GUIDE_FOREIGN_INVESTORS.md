## 4. Capital Requirements by Sector {#capital-requirements}

### General Rule

**IDR 10 billion per 5-digit KBLI per location** (excludes land/buildings)

### Sector-Specific Variations

| Sector | KBLI | Requirement | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| **General** | Any 5-digit | IDR 10B | Excludes land/buildings |
| **Wholesale** | 46xxx | IDR 10B | Per **first 2 digits** |
| **F&B** | 56xxx | IDR 10B | Per **regency/city** (not per KBLI) |
| **Construction** | 41xxx, 42xxx | IDR 10B | Per activity |
| **Construction Implementation** | - | IDR 50B net worth | SBU certification |
| **Real Estate (integrated)** | 68111 | IDR 10B | **Includes** land/buildings |
| **E-commerce (100% foreign)** | 47919 | IDR 100B | High barrier |

### Important Clarifications

#### **Wholesale Exception (46xxx)**:

#### **F&B Exception (56xxx)**:
- Capital per **regency/city** (geographic, not per KBLI)
- Example: Restaurant + bar + catering in Badung = **IDR 10B total**
- But: Same 3 KBLI in Badung + Denpasar = **IDR 20B** (2 cities)

#### **Real Estate Exception (68111)**:
- Only exception where **land + buildings INCLUDED** in IDR 10B
- Rationale: Integrated residential development inherently includes land

### Paid-Up Capital vs Total Investment

**Paid-Up Capital**:
- Money actually deposited in company bank account
- **Minimum**: IDR 10 billion for PT PMA
- **Typical**: 25% of authorized capital (regulatory requirement)

**Total Investment**:
- Includes paid-up capital + assets + equipment + future planned investment
- **Minimum**: IDR 10 billion per KBLI per location
- **Excludes**: Land & buildings (except real estate 68111)

**Example**:

### Costs of Multiple KBLI Codes

**Capital multiplication**: Each KBLI Ã— each location = IDR 10B
- Example: 3 KBLI Ã— 2 locations = IDR 60B minimum investment

**Complexity**: More licenses, more compliance, more reporting

**Exceptions reduce cost**:
- Wholesale: IDR 10B per **first 2 digits** (not per 5-digit)
- F&B: IDR 10B per **regency/city** (not per KBLI)
- Multi-KBLI environmental permit (PP 28/2025): 1 permit for integrated activities

- Capital: **IDR 20B** (IDR 10B each, different categories)
- Business model: Own villas + manage others' properties

#### **Architecture + Interior Design + Construction Consulting (Same Location)**
- KBLI: 71101 + 74120 + 71102
- Capital: **IDR 30B** (IDR 10B each)
- Business model: Integrated design-build services

#### **Wholesale Import/Export (Multiple Products)**
- KBLI: 46101 + 46102 + 46103 (all start with 46)
- Capital: **IDR 10B** (exception: first 2 digits only)
- Business model: Multi-product importer/distributor

## ðŸš¨ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. **Selecting Wrong KBLI Code**
- **Problem**: Code doesn't match actual business activity
- **Consequence**: License revocation, fines, legal issues
- **Solution**: Consult with licensed business consultant, verify with BKPM

### 2. **Insufficient Capital (Multiple KBLI)**
- **Problem**: Not calculating capital per KBLI per location
- **Consequence**: License rejection, cannot operate
- **Solution**: Calculate: (# of KBLI Ã— # of locations) Ã— IDR 10B (check exceptions)

### 3. **Ignoring Capital Exceptions**
- **Problem**: Overpaying capital for wholesale or F&B
- **Solution**: Remember:
  - Wholesale: per first 2 digits
  - F&B: per regency/city

### 4. **Choosing Closed Sector (47xxx Retail)**
- **Problem**: Selecting offline retail KBLI (always rejected)
- **Consequence**: Cannot obtain NIB, wasted setup costs
- **Solution**: Choose wholesale (46xxx) or e-commerce (47919 with IDR 100B) instead

### 5. **Missing Halal Certification (F&B)**
- **Problem**: Not obtaining halal cert by Oct 17, 2026
- **Consequence**: Business closure, fines
- **Solution**: Apply for halal certification NOW (BPJPH - Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Produk Halal)

### 6. **Assuming 100% Foreign Ownership (Construction)**
- **Problem**: Construction is 67%-70% max, not 100%
- **Consequence**: License rejection
- **Solution**: Find local partner (30-33% Indonesian ownership)

### 7. **Not Updating KBLI When Business Changes**
- **Problem**: Operating activities not covered by registered KBLI
- **Consequence**: Business interruption, fines, license issues
- **Solution**: Add KBLI via OSS whenever expanding activities
