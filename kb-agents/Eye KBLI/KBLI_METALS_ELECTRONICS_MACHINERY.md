## Capital Requirements & Timeline

### Capital Calculation Formula

```
Minimum Capital = KBLI Count × Location Count × IDR 10B
(excludes land and buildings)

Examples:

1. Single KBLI, single location:
   KBLI 27111 (Electric Motors) in Jakarta
   = 1 × 1 × IDR 10B = IDR 10B minimum

2. Multiple KBLI, single location:
   KBLI 2610 (Electronic Components) + KBLI 2620 (Computers) in Batam
   = 2 × 1 × IDR 10B = IDR 20B minimum

3. Single KBLI, multiple locations:
   KBLI 2410 (Steel) in Jakarta + Surabaya + Medan
   = 1 × 3 × IDR 10B = IDR 30B minimum
```

**Important Notes**:
- Land & buildings NOT included in minimum capital
- Equipment costs NOT included
- Paid-up capital: Minimum 25% of authorized = IDR 2.5B per KBLI

---

### Realistic Capital Requirements (by Sector)

| Sector | KBLI | Minimum Legal | Realistic Total | Timeline |
|--------|------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Steel Manufacturing** | 2410 | IDR 10B | IDR 100B-1T | 24-36 mo |
| **Aluminum Smelting** | 24202 | IDR 10B | IDR 500B-5T | 36-48 mo |
| **Metal Fabrication** | 2511 | IDR 10B | IDR 20B-100B | 12-18 mo |
| **Semiconductor** | 2610 | IDR 10B | IDR 500B-5T | 36-48 mo |

## Common Mistakes & Warnings

### Mistake 1: Not Obtaining AMDAL Before Construction

**Scenario**: Company builds factory, then applies for AMDAL

**What Happens**:
```
Government Response:
❌ AMDAL application REJECTED (construction started before approval)
❌ Factory CANNOT operate (no environmental permit)
❌ Fine: IDR 100M-1B
❌ Must demolish or relocate factory (if environmental issues)

Result: IDR 50B-500B wasted, 2-3 years lost
```

**Correct Sequence**:
1. Company formation → 2. AMDAL approval → 3. Factory construction → 4. Operating license

---

### Mistake 2: Choosing Wrong KBLI Code

**Scenario**: Company registers as KBLI 2620 (Computer Assembly) but actually manufactures semiconductors (KBLI 2610)

**What Happens**:
```
Audit Response:
❌ Business activity doesn't match NIB
❌ Operating license SUSPENDED
❌ Cannot export products (HS code mismatch)
❌ Cannot apply for tax incentives (wrong KBLI)

Fix: Re-register with correct KBLI (2-4 weeks delay)
```

**How to Avoid**:
- Verify KBLI description matches actual operations
- Check OSS portal for exact classification
- Consult with industrial registration consultant

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring SNI Certification for Domestic Sales

**Scenario**: Company manufactures electrical equipment without SNI

**What Happens**:
```
Market Entry Blocked:
❌ Cannot sell to government (SNI mandatory for procurement)
❌ Cannot sell to modern retail (SNI required by chains)
❌ Customs blocks imports of non-SNI products (if components imported)
❌ Fine: IDR 50M-200M per violation

Result: Lost market access, revenue impacted
```

**Mandatory SNI Products** (Metal/Electronics/Machinery):
- Steel bars, rods (SNI 07-2052-2002)
- Electric cables (SNI 04-6629.2-2006)
- Electric motors (SNI IEC 60034)
- Batteries (SNI 04-3979-1995)
- Domestic appliances (various SNI)
- Pressure vessels (SNI 1727:2008)

---

### Mistake 4: Not Planning for Hazardous Waste (B3)

**Scenario**: Metal coating factory (KBLI 2592) operates without B3 license

**What Happens**:
```
Environmental Inspection:
❌ Chemical waste (electroplating, galvanizing) illegally stored
❌ No hazardous waste transport license
❌ No wastewater treatment plant

Penalties:
- Fine: IDR 250M-1B
- Factory CLOSURE: 3-6 months (until compliance)
- Criminal prosecution: Directors face 3-5 years prison
- Environmental restoration costs: IDR 500M-5B
```

**B3 (Hazardous Waste) Required for**:
- KBLI 2592 (Metal coating) - electroplating chemicals
- KBLI 2720 (Batteries) - lithium, lead, acid
- KBLI 2410 (Steel) - slag, furnace waste
- KBLI 24202 (Non-ferrous metals) - smelting residues

**B3 License Requirements**:
- Hazardous waste storage facility (certified construction)
- Waste transportation license (certified vehicles)
- Waste treatment contract (licensed disposal company)
- Costs: Bali Zero — service pricing excluded; see Desktop/BalizeroPricelist2025.txt; regulatory authority fees may apply.

---

### Mistake 5: Misunderstanding TKDN (Local Content) for Government Sales

**Scenario**: Foreign electronics manufacturer expects to sell to government without TKDN

**What Happens**:
```
Government Procurement Response:
❌ Bid REJECTED (TKDN certificate required)
❌ Must have 25-40% local content (depending on product)
❌ Cannot participate in tender

Result: Lost government contracts (30-40% of market)
```

**TKDN Requirements** (Manufacturing):
- Electronics: 25-40% local content
- Machinery: 20-35% local content
- Telecommunication equipment: 30-40% local content

**How to Achieve TKDN**:
- Local component sourcing
- Local assembly/manufacturing
- Local R&D expenses
- Local employment (Indonesian workers)

**TKDN Calculation**:
```
TKDN = (Local Cost / Total Cost) × 100%

Example:
Total Product Cost: IDR 100M
- Imported components: IDR 60M
- Local components: IDR 20M
- Local labor: IDR 15M
- Local overheads: IDR 5M

TKDN = (20M + 15M + 5M) / 100M × 100% = 40% ✅
```

---

### Mistake 6: Not Retaining Export Proceeds (30% Rule)

**Scenario**: Steel exporter (KBLI 2410) exports USD 10M/year, doesn't retain 30% in Indonesia

**What Happens**:
```
Bank Indonesia Audit:
❌ Violation of BI Regulation 9/2024
❌ Fine: 5% of unreturned proceeds
❌ Export license suspension (3-6 months)

Example Penalty:
USD 10M exports × 30% = USD 3M should be retained
If not retained: Fine = USD 3M × 5% = USD 150K
```

**Who Must Comply** (Manufacturing Exports):
- Metal exporters (KBLI 24xxx): If >USD 250K/year
- Electronics exporters (KBLI 26xxx): If >USD 250K/year
- Machinery exporters (KBLI 28xxx): If >USD 250K/year

**Retention Rule**: 30% of export proceeds must be held in Indonesian banks for minimum 3 months

---

### Mistake 7: Starting Production Without Operating License

**Scenario**: Factory completed, starts production during operating license processing

**What Happens**:
```
Government Inspection:
❌ Operating without Izin Komersial/Operasional
❌ Factory SEALED immediately (Satpol PP enforcement)
❌ Products SEIZED (cannot be sold)
❌ Fine: IDR 100M-500M
❌ License application REJECTED (must reapply)

Result: 3-6 months revenue lost, IDR 100M-500M fine
```

**Correct Sequence for High-Risk Manufacturing**:
1. ✅ NIB obtained (company registered)
2. ✅ AMDAL approved (environmental clearance)
3. ✅ Factory construction (with building permits)
4. ✅ SLF obtained (building safety certificate)
5. ✅ Product certifications (SNI, safety certificates)
6. ✅ **Operating License obtained** ← START HERE
7. ✅ Production commences
8. ✅ Sales begin

---

### Mistake 8: Hiring Foreign Workers Without RPTKA

**Scenario**: Company hires foreign engineers without work permits

**What Happens**:
```
Immigration Raid:
❌ Foreign workers DEPORTED
❌ Company fine: USD 10K per illegal worker
❌ Director fine: USD 5K personal penalty
❌ Business license SUSPENDED (3-6 months)
❌ KITAS renewal DENIED for all foreign workers

Example: 5 foreign engineers × USD 10K = USD 50K fine
```

**Correct Process**:
1. Apply for RPTKA (Work Permit Plan): 2-4 weeks, IDR 2M-5M per worker
2. Pengesahan RPTKA (Validation): 1-2 weeks
3. Foreign worker applies for e-Visa: 1-2 weeks, USD 50-110
4. Obtain e-ITAS (KITAS): 1-2 weeks after arrival, IDR 1M-2M
5. Pay DKP-TKA: USD 100/month per worker

**Total cost per foreign worker**: ~IDR 15M-25M first year + USD 100/mo ongoing
