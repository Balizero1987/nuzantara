## LAND OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS - CRITICAL FOR AGRICULTURE

### FOREIGN LAND RIGHTS IN INDONESIA

**Foreigners CANNOT own the following land titles:**
1. **Hak Milik (Freehold Title)** - Reserved exclusively for Indonesian citizens
2. Agricultural land ownership PROHIBITED for foreigners

**Foreigners CAN obtain:**
1. **Hak Pakai (Right to Use)**
   - Duration: 45 years, renewable for 25 years (70 years total)
   - Allowed for: Residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural USE
   - Cannot be sold, but can be transferred with approval
   - Applicable to: Indonesian citizens, foreigners domiciled in Indonesia, PT PMA companies, representative offices

2. **Hak Guna Bangunan (Building Rights)**
   - Duration: 30 years, renewable for 20 years (50 years total)
   - For buildings/structures on state land or land with Hak Pengelolaan
   - Typically for industrial/commercial buildings

3. **Hak Guna Usaha (Cultivation Rights)**
   - Duration: 35 years, renewable for 25 years (60 years total)
   - For plantation and agriculture businesses
   - Minimum 5 hectares, maximum 25 hectares (individuals) or no limit (companies)
   - PT PMA (foreign investment companies) can hold HGU

### WORKAROUND FOR AGRICULTURAL LAND

Foreign investors in agriculture typically:
1. Establish **PT PMA** (Indonesian foreign investment company)
2. PT PMA obtains **Hak Guna Usaha (HGU)** for plantation/agriculture
3. PT PMA obtains **Hak Pakai** for facilities/buildings
4. Land is LEASED/USED, not owned outright

**Critical Warnings:**
- ⚠️ Land acquisition process complex (community rights, land certification)
- ⚠️ "Hak Ulayat" (customary land rights) can override formal titles
- ⚠️ Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) from local communities required
- ⚠️ Land disputes common - thorough due diligence essential

## COMMON MISTAKES & PITFALLS BY SECTOR

### AGRICULTURE
1. ❌ **Assuming land ownership is possible**
   - Foreigners cannot own Hak Milik (freehold) land
   - Must use PT PMA with Hak Guna Usaha or Hak Pakai

2. ❌ **Ignoring community land rights (Hak Ulayat)**
   - Customary rights can override formal titles
   - FPIC (Free, Prior, Informed Consent) essential

3. ❌ **Underestimating partnership requirements**
   - Rice and certain crops may require local cooperative partnership
   - Plantation Bill threatens 30% foreign ownership cap

4. ❌ **Starting operations before full permits**
   - NIB alone is NOT sufficient for high-risk activities
   - Must obtain Sertifikat Standar or Izin Usaha

5. ❌ **Neglecting environmental compliance**
   - UKL-UPL or AMDAL required before operations
   - Failure to comply leads to permit revocation

### FORESTRY
1. ❌ **Attempting 100% foreign ownership**
   - Most forestry activities restricted to 49% or closed entirely
   - Must partner with Indonesian state enterprises

2. ❌ **Operating without SVLK certification**
   - SVLK (timber legality) is MANDATORY
   - Export impossible without SVLK

3. ❌ **Harvesting protected species**
   - Protected wood species are illegal to harvest
   - CITES Appendix species heavily regulated

4. ❌ **Ignoring reforestation obligations**
   - Must replant harvested areas
   - Post-harvest monitoring required

5. ❌ **Inadequate community engagement**
   - Social license to operate critical
   - Community forest rights must be respected

### FISHING & AQUACULTURE
1. ❌ **Exceeding 49% foreign ownership in capture fishing**
   - Strictly enforced cap
   - Controlling stake must be Indonesian

2. ❌ **Operating fishing vessels without VMS**

   - Biosecurity protocols critical

6. ❌ **Converting mangroves to aquaculture ponds**
   - Illegal and environmentally destructive
   - Mangrove protection strictly enforced

### MINING
1. ❌ **Ignoring divestment obligations**
   - MUST divest to Indonesian ownership (typically to 49% foreign within 5-10 years)
   - Failure to divest can result in permit revocation

2. ❌ **Starting before AMDAL approval**
   - All mining requires AMDAL before operations
   - Criminal penalties for non-compliance

3. ❌ **Not budgeting for reclamation**
   - Reclamation guarantee deposit substantial
   - Progressive reclamation required (not just at closure)

4. ❌ **Ignoring Domestic Market Obligation (DMO)**
   - Must supply portion to domestic market at regulated prices
   - Export restrictions possible

5. ❌ **Inadequate community engagement**
   - Mining highly controversial
   - Community opposition can halt projects

6. ❌ **Not securing Clean & Clear (C&C) certification**
   - Land must be legally clear of all claims
   - Overlapping claims common

7. ❌ **Assuming raw material export is allowed**
   - Indonesia promotes downstream processing
   - Export bans or restrictions on unprocessed minerals/coal

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS FOR INVESTORS

1. **Sector Selection**
   - Choose KBLI codes carefully based on foreign ownership restrictions
   - Avoid heavily restricted sectors (forestry, natural forest, protected species)
   - Consider aquaculture over capture fishing for easier foreign ownership

2. **Legal Structure**
   - Establish PT PMA (Indonesian foreign investment company)
   - Minimum paid-up capital: IDR 10 billion per KBLI code
   - Consider reduced capital requirement (IDR 2.5 billion) if applicable

3. **Land Acquisition**
   - Conduct thorough land due diligence (check for Hak Ulayat claims)
   - Obtain Hak Guna Usaha (HGU) for agricultural/plantation operations
   - Budget 12-24 months for land clearance and certification

4. **Environmental Compliance**
   - Engage certified AMDAL/UKL-UPL consultants early
   - Budget adequately for environmental assessments and ongoing monitoring
   - Develop community engagement and FPIC protocols

5. **Partnership Strategy**
   - Identify potential Indonesian partners for restricted sectors
   - Ensure partnership agreements protect foreign investor interests
   - Consider technology transfer and capacity building as part of partnership value

6. **Regulatory Engagement**
   - Engage with BKPM/OSS system for investment facilitation
   - Work with relevant ministries (Agriculture, Environment, Maritime, Energy)
   - Consider hiring Indonesian regulatory consultants/expediters

7. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Obtain political risk insurance
   - Structure contracts to allow for regulatory changes
   - Budget for extended timelines and cost overruns
   - Prepare for community relations and CSR obligations

8. **Exit Strategy**
   - Understand divestment obligations (especially for mining)
   - Plan for long-term operations (agriculture, plantations have multi-year cycles)
   - Consider listing on Indonesian stock exchange (IDX) as potential exit
