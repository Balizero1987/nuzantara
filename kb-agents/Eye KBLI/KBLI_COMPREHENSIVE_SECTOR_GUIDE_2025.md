Example 3: Hotel chain (1 KBLI, 3 locations: Bali, Jakarta, Lombok)
= 1 √ó 3 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 30B minimum
```

### 4.16 Common Mistakes & Best Practices

#### 5 Critical KBLI Mistakes (PT PMA Setup)

**1. Selecting Wrong or Outdated KBLI Codes**

‚ùå **Mistake**: Using KBLI 2017 codes instead of KBLI 2020
‚úÖ **Impact**: License rejection, system rejection during NIB registration
‚úÖ **Solution**: Always verify against official OSS RBA portal (oss.go.id/informasi/kbli-berbasis-risiko)

**2. Using Restricted Business Activities**

‚ùå **Mistake**: Registering KBLI code on Negative Investment List (DNI)
‚úÖ **Impact**: Foreign ownership issues, license rejection
‚úÖ **Solution**: Check Presidential Regulation 10/2021 + 49/2021 before selecting codes

**3. Combining Unrelated Activities**

‚úÖ **Examples**:
- Construction + Education + Travel Agency

**4. Choosing Codes That Are Too Broad**

‚ùå **Mistake**: Selecting general KBLI code instead of specific 5-digit code
‚úÖ **Impact**: Licensing issues, unclear business scope, potential audit flags
‚úÖ **Solution**: Government wants clear, specific business scope - choose most specific code

**5. Not Verifying OSS RBA Portal**

‚úÖ **Correct**: IDR 10B **per KBLI code per project location**

**Example**:
- Restaurant (56101) + Bar (56301) + Catering (56210) in Bali

---

#### 2. Retail Trade Misconception

‚ùå **Common Error**: "I can open a retail shop with 100% foreign ownership"

**Only options**:
1. E-commerce (47919) with IDR 100B capital
2. E-commerce (47919) with IDR 10B + MSME partnership
3. Wholesale trade (46xxx) - 100% open

‚ùå **Cannot combine**: Wholesale + Retail under one entity (despite same permit type)

---

#### 3. KBLI Code Outdated Error

‚ùå **Common Error**: Using KBLI 2017 codes
‚úÖ **Current version**: KBLI 2020 (since September 24, 2020)

**Impact**: System rejection, license delays, NIB registration failure

**Solution**: Always verify on **oss.go.id/informasi/kbli-berbasis-risiko**

---

#### 4. Combining Incompatible Sectors

‚ùå **Examples**:
