- **Rule**: Multiple KBLI codes with same first 2 digits (56xxx) can share **ONE** IDR 10B investment in same regency/city
- **Example**: Restaurant (56101) + Bar (56301) + Catering (56210) in Badung = **IDR 10B total** (not IDR 30B)
- **Legal Basis**: BKPM Regulation 4/2021

#### **2. Construction (41xxx codes)**
- **Minimum Investment**: IDR 25,000,000,000 (USD ~1.6M) - **HIGHER** than standard
- **Foreign Ownership**: 67% (non-ASEAN) or 70% (ASEAN) - **RESTRICTED**
- **Legal Basis**: Government Regulation 5/2021

### **Multi-KBLI Calculation Examples**

#### **Example 1: Villa + Restaurant + Bar (Bali)**
```
KBLI 55130 (Villa) → IDR 10,000,000,000
KBLI 56101 (Restaurant) → IDR 10,000,000,000 (shared with Bar)
KBLI 56301 (Bar) → Included in 56101 (same first 2 digits, same regency)

TOTAL: IDR 20,000,000,000
```

#### **Example 2: Real Estate + Property Management**
```
KBLI 68111 (Real Estate Sales) → IDR 10,000,000,000
KBLI 68209 (Property Management) → IDR 10,000,000,000

TOTAL: IDR 20,000,000,000 (different codes, both required)
```

#### **Example 3: Villa in Seminyak + Villa in Ubud**
```
KBLI 55130 (Villa Seminyak) → IDR 10,000,000,000
KBLI 55130 (Villa Ubud) → IDR 10,000,000,000

TOTAL: IDR 20,000,000,000 (same KBLI, different locations)
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTES FOR BALI ZERO CLIENTS

### **1. Capital Calculation Mistakes**
Most common error: Thinking IDR 10B is **total** investment.

✅ **CORRECT FORMULA**:
```
Total Minimum Investment = (Number of KBLI codes) × (Number of locations) × IDR 10B

EXCEPTIONS:
- F&B (56xxx): First 2 digits same = share IDR 10B in same regency
- Construction: IDR 25B minimum (not IDR 10B)
```

---

### **2. Land & Buildings NOT Counted**
IDR 10B minimum **excludes**:
- Land purchase price
- Building construction cost
- Building purchase price

**Only counts**:
- Operating capital
- Equipment
- Inventory
- Working capital

---

### **3. Foreign Ownership Restrictions**

| Sector | KBLI | Foreign Ownership | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------------|-------|
| **OPEN** | Most sectors | 100% | Hospitality, F&B, consulting, real estate |
| **RESTRICTED** | Construction (41xxx) | 67-70% | Must partner with Indonesians |
| **CONDITIONALLY OPEN** | Fishery distribution (46206) | 100% | Must partner with Indonesian MSME |
| **CLOSED** | Retail (47xxx) | 0% | Reserved for local companies |

---

### **4. Mandatory Certifications by Sector**

| Sector | Mandatory Certifications | Deadline |
|--------|-------------------------|----------|
| **Food & Beverage** | Halal certification | Already in effect<br>(foreign products: Oct 17, 2026) |
| **Food & Beverage** | Health certificate (Laik Higienis) | Before operations |
| **Spa/Wellness** | Therapist certifications (LSP Spa, BISA) | Before operations |
| **Construction** | SBU (Business Certificate) | Before bidding on projects |
| **Alcohol Sales** | Alcohol license + NPPBCK | Before operations |

---

### **5. Environmental Permits (Often Forgotten)**

| Business Type | Required Permit | Cost | Timeline |
|---------------|----------------|------|----------|
| **Small office/cafe** | SPPL | IDR 500K-5M | 1-2 weeks |
| **Medium restaurant/villa** | UKL-UPL | IDR 5M-50M | 1-2 months |
| **Large hotel/resort** | AMDAL | IDR 50M-500M+ | 3-6 months |

**⚠️ Critical**: Cannot operate without environmental permit. Often causes delays if not planned early.

---

### **6. Alcohol Licensing (Bali-Specific)**

**Timeline**: 45-90 days (often underestimated)

**Key Requirements**:
1. Letter of appointment from **distributor** (not supplier) as authorized seller
2. NPPBCK registration (excise goods ID)
3. Specify alcohol class (A, B, or C) - cannot change without new application

**Provincial Variation**: Bali is permissive, but other provinces extremely restrictive or ban alcohol entirely.

---

### **7. Building Permits Timeline**

**PBG (Building Approval)**: Required **before** construction
**SLF (Certificate of Worthiness)**: Required **before** operations

**Common Mistake**: Starting construction before PBG, or operating before SLF → illegal, fines, closure

**Timeline**:
- PBG: 2-4 weeks (if documents complete)
- SLF: 1-2 weeks (after construction complete)

---

### **8. NIB Does NOT Mean "Ready to Operate"**

**NIB** = Business Identification Number (first step)

**Still Need** (depending on KBLI):
- Business License (Izin Usaha)
- Commercial License (Izin Komersial)
- Sector-specific licenses (alcohol, health, tourism, etc.)
- Environmental permits
- Building permits
- Product certifications (Halal, BPOM, etc.)

**Timeline**: NIB = 3-5 days, **Full operational licensing** = 30-120 days
