## 4. Retail vs Wholesale Cases

### Case 4.1: WRONG - Retail Store Attempt

**Client Profile**:
- Name: FashionCo (French company)
- Business: Clothing retail store in Bali
- Intent: Sell imported fashion brands
- Investment budget: IDR 20B

**WRONG KBLI Selection**:
- ‚ùå **KBLI 47xxx**: Retail Trade (ANY code starting with 47)

**Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Retail clothing store (offline)
KBLI attempted: 47xxx (any retail code)

Result: ‚ùå APPLICATION REJECTED

Reason: ALL offline retail trade (47xxx) is CLOSED to foreign investment

Foreign Ownership: 0% ‚ö†Ô∏è PROHIBITED
```

**OSS System Response**:
```
ERROR: KBLI 47xxx is not available for foreign investment (PT PMA).
This business line is closed to foreign ownership per Presidential Regulation 10/2021.

Recommendation:
1. Change business model to wholesale (46xxx) - 100% foreign allowed
2. Change business model to e-commerce (47919) - 100% foreign allowed with conditions
3. Partner with Indonesian citizen (99% local / 1% nominee - NOT RECOMMENDED)
4. Register as CV/local business (requires Indonesian citizen as legal owner)
```

**What Client Should Do Instead**:
See Case 4.2 or 4.3 below

---

### Case 4.2: CORRECT - Wholesale + E-commerce Model

**Client Profile**:
- Name: FashionCo (French company) - same client as Case 4.1
- Business: Import & distribute fashion brands (revised model)
- Intent: Wholesale to retailers + e-commerce platform
- Investment budget: IDR 120B (revised for e-commerce)

**Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 46420**: Wholesale of Clothing
- **KBLI 47919**: Retail Trade via E-commerce

**Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Wholesale distribution + e-commerce
KBLI count: 2
Location count: 1 (Bali/Jakarta warehouse)

Capital Calculation for KBLI 46420 (Wholesale):
- Formula: 1 √ó 1 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 10B minimum
- Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED

Capital Calculation for KBLI 47919 (E-commerce):
- Option 1: IDR 100B for 100% foreign ownership (NO local partner)
- Option 2: IDR 10B with MSME partnership
- Client budget: IDR 120B ‚úÖ SUFFICIENT for Option 1

Total Minimum Capital: IDR 10B (wholesale) + IDR 100B (e-commerce) = IDR 110B
Client budget: IDR 120B ‚úÖ SUFFICIENT

Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED (both codes, no local partner needed)

Risk Level:
- KBLI 46420 (Wholesale): Low (L)
- KBLI 47919 (E-commerce): Low (L)

Required Licenses:
1. NIB - Instant
2. Business License - Instant (Low risk both codes)
3. API-U (General Import License) - if importing directly
   Cost: Free (online via OSS)
   Processing: Instant
   Requirements: Valid NIB + PT PMA status
4. No retail store license needed (online only) ‚úÖ

Total Licensing Costs: IDR 1M-3M (administrative)
Total Timeline: 1-2 weeks
```

**Business Model**:
```
Revenue Stream 1: Wholesale (B2B)
- Sell to Indonesian retailers (batik shops, boutiques, malls)
- Minimum order quantities (MOQ)
- Payment terms: Net 30-60 days
- Margins: 30-50%

Revenue Stream 2: E-commerce (B2C)
- Sell directly to consumers via website/app
- Platforms: Own website, Tokopedia, Shopee, Lazada
- Payment: Credit card, e-wallet, bank transfer
- Margins: 50-100% (retail price)

Warehouse/Office:
- Jakarta or Bali (choose one)
- Size: 500-1000m¬≤ for inventory
- Staff: 10-20 (operations, customer service, logistics)
```

**Key Distinctions**:
- **KBLI 46420**: Sell to OTHER BUSINESSES (retailers) - wholesale ‚úÖ
- **KBLI 47919**: Sell to END CONSUMERS via ONLINE platform - e-commerce ‚úÖ
- ‚ùå **CANNOT have physical retail store** (47xxx offline = closed)
- ‚úÖ **CAN have showroom** (for wholesale buyers only, not public walk-in)

**Why IDR 100B for E-commerce?**
Presidential Regulation 10/2021 states:
- E-commerce 100% foreign ownership requires **IDR 100B minimum investment**
- If IDR 10B investment ‚Üí must partner with MSME (local business)

**Client's Choice**:
‚úÖ Option 1: IDR 120B investment, 100% foreign, NO local partner (RECOMMENDED)
‚ö†Ô∏è Option 2: IDR 20B investment (10B wholesale + 10B e-commerce), but need MSME partnership for e-commerce (COMPLEX)

---

### Case 4.3: CORRECT - Wholesale Only Model

**Client Profile**:
- Name: FashionCo (French company) - if lower budget
- Business: Import & distribute fashion brands (wholesale only)
- Intent: Wholesale to retailers only (no e-commerce)
- Investment budget: IDR 15B

**Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 46420**: Wholesale of Clothing

**Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Wholesale distribution only
KBLI count: 1
Location count: 1

Capital Calculation:
- Formula: 1 √ó 1 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 10B minimum
- Client budget: IDR 15B ‚úÖ SUFFICIENT

Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED

Risk Level: Low (L)

Total Timeline: 1 week
Total Costs: IDR 1M-2M
```

**Why This Works**:
‚úÖ Much lower capital requirement (IDR 10B vs IDR 110B for wholesale+e-commerce)
‚úÖ 100% foreign ownership
‚úÖ Fast setup
‚úÖ No complex e-commerce platform needed
‚ùå Cannot sell directly to consumers (B2B only)

## 5. Multi-Location Business Cases

### Case 5.1: Coffee Shop Chain

**Client Profile**:
- Name: BeanCo (Canadian company)
- Business: Coffee shop chain
- Locations: 5 shops (3 in Bali, 1 in Jakarta, 1 in Yogyakarta)
- Investment budget: IDR 60B

**Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 56101**: Restaurant (coffee shop classified as restaurant)

**Analysis**:
```
Business Type: F&B chain (coffee shops)
KBLI count: 1 (56101)
Location count: 5

Capital Calculation:
- Formula: 1 √ó 5 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 50B minimum
- Client budget: IDR 60B ‚úÖ SUFFICIENT

Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED

Risk Level: Medium (M)

Per-Location Requirements (√ó5):
1. Environmental Permit: SPPL (small coffee shop)
   Cost: IDR 1M-3M each √ó 5 = IDR 5M-15M
   Processing: 1-2 weeks each (can be parallel)

2. Halal Certification (MANDATORY by Oct 17, 2026)
   Option A: One certificate for all 5 locations (same menu)
   Cost: IDR 3M-8M (covering all SKUs)
   Option B: Separate certificates per location
   Cost: IDR 2M-4M each √ó 5 = IDR 10M-20M
   RECOMMENDED: Option A (cheaper, simpler)

3. Health Certificate per location
   Cost: IDR 1M-2M each √ó 5 = IDR 5M-10M
   Validity: 1 year (renewable)

4. Building Permits (PBG) per location
   Cost: IDR 3M-8M each √ó 5 = IDR 15M-40M
   Processing: 14-30 days each

5. SLF per location (MANDATORY before opening)
   Cost: IDR 2M-5M each √ó 5 = IDR 10M-25M
   Processing: 7-14 days per location

6. TDUP (if tourist-focused, especially Bali locations)
   Cost: IDR 5M-10M per Bali location √ó 3 = IDR 15M-30M
   Jakarta/Yogya: Not required (not tourism areas)

Total Licensing Costs: IDR 50M - 140M
Total Timeline: 3-4 months for all 5 locations
```

**Strategic Planning**:
```
Launch Strategy:
Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Setup 3 Bali locations (parallel processing)
- Canggu (flagship)
- Seminyak
- Ubud

Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Setup Jakarta + Yogyakarta
- Once Bali operations proven

Rationale:
- Bali has same local regulations (can use same consultant)
- Test business model in Bali first (tourist market)
- Expand to Jakarta/Yogya after product-market fit

PP 28/2025 Benefit:
‚úÖ Single environmental approval MAY cover all locations if:
- Same company
- Same menu/operations
- Same business model
(Check with environmental consultant - this is new regulation)
```

**F&B Specific Notes**:
- **Halal certification**: Get ONE certificate for all locations (same menu)
- **Health certificates**: Must be separate per location (local health dept)
- **Menu consistency**: Keep same menu across all locations for easier licensing

### Case 5.2: Real Estate Development (Multi-Project)

- Name: DevGroup (Hong Kong company)
- Business: Residential real estate development
- Projects: 3 villa developments (10 villas each = 30 villas total)
- Locations: Canggu, Ubud, Sanur (all Bali)
- Investment budget: IDR 150B

**WRONG Approach**:
```
‚ùå MISTAKE: Selecting KBLI 68111 (Real Estate Owned or Leased)

Why wrong?
- KBLI 68111 is for RENTING properties you own
- NOT for BUILDING then SELLING properties
```

**Correct KBLI Selection**:
- **KBLI 41011**: Residential Building Construction
- **KBLI 68111**: Real Estate Owned or Leased (if some villas will be rented)

**Analysis**:
```

KBLI count: 2 (41011 construction + 68111 rental for unsold inventory)
Location count: 3 (Canggu, Ubud, Sanur)

Capital Calculation:
- Formula: 2 √ó 3 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 60B minimum (for licensing)
- PLUS: Construction costs (land + building)

- Construction: IDR 1B-2B per villa √ó 30 = IDR 30B-60B
- Total project cost: IDR 150B-270B
- Client budget: IDR 150B ‚ö†Ô∏è TIGHT (minimum feasible)

Foreign Ownership: 67% MAX for KBLI 41011 (construction)
- Need 33% Indonesian partner
- If Hong Kong counts as "special agreement": Check eligibility

PT PMA Structure:
- Authorized capital: IDR 150B
- Foreign shareholder: 67% = IDR 100.5B

   Cost: IDR 20M-35M
5. LPJK Registration - 2-3 weeks
   Cost: IDR 8M-12M

Per-Project Requirements (√ó3 developments):
1. Environmental Permit: AMDAL (10 villas = large development)
   Cost: IDR 50M-100M per project √ó 3 = IDR 150M-300M
   Processing: 3-6 months per project
   Note: Can start while company setup is in progress

2. PBG (Building Permit) per villa:
   Cost: IDR 8M-15M per villa √ó 30 = IDR 240M-450M

- Marketing: IDR 10B-20B
- Operating costs (2.5 years): IDR 20B-30B
- Total Costs: IDR 121B-261B

Profit: IDR 119B-189B (if all villas sold)
ROI: 79%-126%
Timeline: 2.5-3 years

Risk Factors:
‚ö†Ô∏è AMDAL approval (can be rejected or delayed)
‚ö†Ô∏è Environmental objections from community
‚ö†Ô∏è Sales risk (villas may not sell quickly in Bali market saturation)
‚ö†Ô∏è Foreign ownership 67% limit (partner dispute risk)
‚ö†Ô∏è Nominee buyer risks (foreigners cannot own freehold)
```

**Client Recommendation**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **High complexity**: This is a major real estate development project
‚úÖ **Consider hiring**: Indonesian partner (33%) with construction experience
‚úÖ **Alternative**: Start with 1 development (10 villas) first, then expand
‚úÖ **Risk mitigation**: Pre-sell villas before construction (50% deposit model common in Bali)

## 6. Multi-KBLI Business Cases

### Case 6.1: Co-working Space + Caf√©

**Client Profile**:
- Name: WorkHub (Singapore)
- Business: Co-working space with caf√©
- Location: Canggu, Bali
- Investment budget: IDR 30B

**Correct KBLI Selection**:

- **KBLI 56101**: Restaurant (for caf√©)

**Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Co-working + F&B
KBLI count: 2
Location count: 1 (Canggu)

Capital Calculation:
- Formula: 2 √ó 1 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 20B minimum
- Client budget: IDR 30B ‚úÖ SUFFICIENT

Foreign Ownership: 100% ‚úÖ ALLOWED (both codes)

Risk Level:
- KBLI 68110: Low (L)
- KBLI 56101: Medium (M)
- Overall: Medium (M)

Business Justification:
‚úÖ RELATED activities: Co-working members use caf√©
‚úÖ INTEGRATED operations: Same building, same staff, complementary services
‚úÖ COMMON business model: Many co-working spaces have F&B

Required Licenses:
1. NIB - Instant
2. Business License - 3-5 days

For Co-working Space (KBLI 68110):
3. Building Permit (PBG)
   Cost: IDR 10M-20M

Total Timeline: 2-3 months
```

**Revenue Model**:
```
Co-working Revenue:
- Hot desk: IDR 100K-150K/day √ó 20 desks √ó 20 days = IDR 40M-60M/month
- Dedicated desk: IDR 2M-3M/month √ó 10 desks = IDR 20M-30M/month
- Private office: IDR 5M-8M/month √ó 5 offices = IDR 25M-40M/month
Co-working Total: IDR 85M-130M/month

Caf√© Revenue:
- Members: IDR 50K/person/day √ó 50 members √ó 20 days = IDR 50M/month
- Walk-ins: IDR 30M-50M/month (tourists, locals)

‚úÖ 100% foreign ownership both codes
‚úÖ Strong revenue model (2 income streams)
‚úÖ Canggu market demand (digital nomads + tourists)

### Case 6.2: WRONG - Unrelated KBLI Combination

**Client Profile**:
- Name: GlobalGroup (UK company)
- Business: Multiple unrelated businesses
- Intent: Mining + Education + Travel Agency
- Investment budget: IDR 100B

**WRONG KBLI Selection**:
- ‚ùå KBLI 05xxx: Mining
- ‚ùå KBLI 85321: Higher Education
- ‚ùå KBLI 79111: Travel Agency

**Analysis**:
```
Business Type: Multiple unrelated industries
KBLI count: 3
Location count: 1

Capital Calculation:
- Formula: 3 √ó 1 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 30B minimum
- Client budget: IDR 100B ‚úÖ SUFFICIENT (but irrelevant)

Result: ‚ùå APPLICATION LIKELY REJECTED

Reason: Unrelated business activities with NO justification

OSS System Response:
"Business activities are not related or integrated. Please provide:
1. Business justification for combining these sectors
2. How operations are integrated
3. Shared resources or synergies

If no justification: Register separate PT PMA for each business line."
```

**Why This Fails**:
‚ùå **Mining + Education**: No logical connection
‚ùå **Education + Travel**: Weak connection (student tours?)
‚ùå **Mining + Travel**: No connection at all
‚ùå **Regulatory conflicts**: Each sector has different ministries, regulations, compliance

**What Would Be Accepted**:
‚úÖ **Mining + Environmental Services**: Related (mine rehabilitation)
‚úÖ **Education + Consulting**: Related (training programs)
‚úÖ **Travel Agency + Hotel**: Related (tourism industry)

**Client Recommendation**:
Create 3 separate PT PMA companies:
- PT Mining Indonesia (KBLI 05xxx)
- PT Education Global (KBLI 85321)
- PT Travel Solutions (KBLI 79111)

Each with IDR 10B minimum capital (total IDR 30B for 3 companies)

## 7. Common Mistake Scenarios

### Mistake 7.1: Using KBLI 2017 Instead of KBLI 2020

**Client Scenario**:
- Client uses old consultant's KBLI list from 2017
- Selects KBLI 47111 (Retail Sale in Non-Specialized Stores) from 2017 list

**What Happens**:
```
OSS System Response:
‚ùå ERROR: KBLI code 47111 not found in KBLI 2020 database

Action Required:
1. Verify KBLI code on official OSS portal: oss.go.id/informasi/kbli-berbasis-risiko
2. Use KBLI 2020 codes only (issued September 24, 2020)
3. Re-submit application with correct code

Result: Application REJECTED, must restart
Time Lost: 1-2 weeks
```

**Correct Action**:
Always verify KBLI codes on official OSS portal (oss.go.id) before submission

**How to Spot Outdated Codes**:
- KBLI 2020 has 1,417 codes (KBLI 2017 had fewer)
- 216 NEW codes added in 2020 (YouTubers, digital platforms, etc.)
- If code not found on OSS portal ‚Üí outdated

---

### Mistake 7.2: Misunderstanding Capital "Per KBLI Per Location"

**Client Scenario**:
- Client wants restaurant + bar in 2 locations (Seminyak + Ubud)
- Thinks: "IDR 10B total investment is enough"

**Client's Wrong Calculation**:
```
IDR 10B total for PT PMA ‚ùå
```

**Correct Calculation**:
```
KBLI count: 2 (restaurant + bar)
Location count: 2 (Seminyak + Ubud)

Formula: 2 √ó 2 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 40B minimum

Breakdown:
- Restaurant Seminyak: IDR 10B
- Bar Seminyak: IDR 10B
- Restaurant Ubud: IDR 10B
- Bar Ubud: IDR 10B
Total: IDR 40B (not IDR 10B!)
```

**What Happens if Client Has Only IDR 15B**:
```
OSS System Response:
‚ùå ERROR: Minimum investment requirement not met

Required: IDR 40B (2 KBLI √ó 2 locations √ó IDR 10B)
Declared: IDR 15B
Shortfall: IDR 25B

Action Required:
1. Increase paid-up capital to minimum IDR 40B, OR
2. Reduce KBLI codes (e.g., restaurant only, no bar), OR
3. Reduce locations (e.g., Seminyak only, not Ubud)

Result: Application REJECTED
```

**Client's Options**:
```
Option A: Increase capital to IDR 40B ‚úÖ
Option B: Reduce to 1 KBLI (restaurant only) √ó 2 locations = IDR 20B ‚úÖ
Option C: Reduce to 2 KBLI (restaurant + bar) √ó 1 location = IDR 20B ‚úÖ
Option D: Reduce to 1 KBLI √ó 1 location = IDR 10B ‚úÖ
```

### Mistake 7.3: Nominee Structure for Land Ownership

**Client Scenario**:
- Foreign client wants to buy villa in Bali
- Consultant suggests: "Use Indonesian friend's name, you give them money, they hold title"

**This is ILLEGAL and WILL FAIL**:
```
Legal Reality:
- UUPA Article 21: Foreigners CANNOT own freehold land (Hak Milik)
- Nominee arrangement: ILLEGAL under Indonesian law
- Supreme Court precedent: MA 3020 K/Pdt/2014
  Result: 0 out of 140 cases won by foreigners (100% loss rate)

What Happens:
1. Foreigner pays Indonesian nominee IDR 5B for villa
2. Title in nominee's name (Hak Milik)
3. Nominee disappears / refuses to transfer / sells to someone else
4. Foreigner sues in court
5. Court rules: Agreement is VOID (illegal from the start)
6. Foreigner loses: Money NOT returned, villa NOT transferred

Enforcement (2023 Data):
- 185 land certificates REVOKED (nominee structures discovered)
- 163 foreigners DEPORTED
- IDR 12T+ in property seized by government
```

**Legal Options for Foreigners**:
```
Option 1: Hak Pakai (Right to Use)
- Duration: 25 years + 20 year extension = 45 years max
- Ownership: Your name on certificate
- Cost: Notary IDR 50M-100M, BPN fees IDR 20M-50M
- Can sell/lease/inherit (with restrictions)
- ‚úÖ LEGAL ‚úÖ SAFE

Option 2: Leasehold (Sewa)
- Duration: 25-30 years (renewable)
- Not ownership, just long-term lease
- Lower upfront cost
- Can extend before expiry
- ‚úÖ LEGAL ‚úÖ SAFE

Option 3: PT PMA (for commercial property)
- Company owns land (HGB - Right to Build)
- Duration: 30+30+20 years = 80 years max
- You own company (67-100% shares depending on KBLI)
- For business purposes only (villa rental, hotel, etc.)
- Cost: IDR 10B minimum investment + setup costs
- ‚úÖ LEGAL ‚úÖ SAFE (if operating business)

Option 4: Marriage to Indonesian Citizen
- Spouse can own Hak Milik (freehold)
- Requires prenup or postnup agreement (separate property)
- Constitutional Court 69/PUU-XIII/2015: Postnup is legal
- Risk: Divorce = lose property (unless protected by agreement)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL but RISKY
```

**What Consultant Should Say**:
‚ùå "Use nominee, it's common, everyone does it"
‚úÖ "Nominee is illegal. Here are 4 legal options with pros/cons of each."

**Case Example - Julian Petroulas (2024)**:
- Australian property consultant in Bali
- Promoted leasehold properties to foreigners
- Misrepresented leaseholds as "ownership"
- Result: BANNED from Indonesia (November 21, 2024)
- Reason: Misleading foreigners, contributing to illegal land transactions

**Bottom Line**:
üö´ **NEVER use nominee structure**
‚úÖ **ALWAYS use legal ownership structure (Hak Pakai, Leasehold, PT PMA)**

---

### Mistake 7.4: Not Getting SLF Before Opening Business

**Client Scenario**:
- Client opens restaurant before obtaining SLF (Building Function Certificate)
- Thinks: "I have business license (NIB), I can open"

**What Happens**:
```
Day 1: Restaurant opens without SLF
Day 3: Government inspection (random or complaint-triggered)
Day 4: BUSINESS SEALED by local government (Satpol PP)

Penalty:
- Fine: IDR 50M-250M
- Business closure until SLF obtained
- Revenue loss: 2-4 weeks (SLF processing time)
- Reputation damage

SLF Requirements:
1. Building architecture inspection
2. Building structure inspection
3. Fire safety inspection
4. Utilities inspection (electrical, plumbing, HVAC)
5. Accessibility inspection (disabled access)

Processing: 7-14 days
Cost: IDR 3M-10M (depends on building size)
Validity: 5 years (renewable)
```

**Correct Sequence**:
```
1. Obtain PBG (Building Permit) - BEFORE construction/renovation
2. Complete construction/renovation
3. Obtain SLF (Building Function Certificate) - BEFORE opening
4. THEN open business to public

Timeline:
PBG: 14-30 days
Construction: 2-6 months (depending on scale)
SLF: 7-14 days after construction complete
TOTAL: 3-7 months (cannot skip steps)
```

**Why This Matters**:
- SLF proves building is SAFE for public use
- Required by law (PP 16/2021 on Building Permits)
- No SLF = no operating license validity
- Insurance companies may refuse claims without valid SLF

Location count: 1 (Jakarta warehouse)

Calculation:
- E-commerce: IDR 100B (fixed for 100% foreign)
- Wholesale: 1 √ó 1 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 10B

Total minimum capital: IDR 110B

Note: If client partners with MSME for e-commerce:
- E-commerce: IDR 10B (with MSME partnership)

### Exercise 8.4: Construction Company (Complex)

**Given**:
- Business: Residential construction
- KBLI: 41011 (Residential Building Construction)
- Will do projects in 3 provinces: Bali, Lombok (NTB), Jakarta
- Registered office: Bali

**Question**: What is the minimum capital requirement?

**Answer**:
```
KBLI count: 1 (41011)
Location count: 3 (Bali, Lombok, Jakarta)

Formula: 1 √ó 3 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 30B

Minimum capital: IDR 30B (excludes land & buildings)

Foreign ownership: 67% non-ASEAN / 70% ASEAN max
- Example: 67% foreign = IDR 20.1B foreign investment
- Example: 33% Indonesian = IDR 9.9B Indonesian investment

Additional Note:
- This is MINIMUM for licensing purposes
- Construction projects require additional capital:
  - Equipment: IDR 10B-50B (excavators, trucks, tools)
  - Working capital: IDR 20B-50B (materials, salaries, deposits)
  - Realistic minimum: IDR 60B-130B total
```

- Restaurant in Denpasar, Bali (KBLI 56101)
- Catering business also in Denpasar, Bali (KBLI 56210)
- Both businesses in SAME regency (Kota Denpasar)

**Question**: What is the minimum capital requirement?

**Answer**:
```
Special Rule for F&B in Same Regency:
- If multiple F&B KBLI codes in SAME regency ‚Üí can SHARE IDR 10B capital

Calculation:
KBLI count: 2 (56101 + 56210)
Location count: 1 (Denpasar)
Same regency: YES

Formula: IDR 10B (shared capital for same regency)

Minimum capital: IDR 10B (not IDR 20B!)

Compare to different regencies:
- Restaurant in Denpasar + Catering in Badung (different regencies)
- Formula: 2 √ó 2 √ó IDR 10B = IDR 40B (no sharing allowed)
```

---

### Scenario 9.2: 67-70% Foreign Ownership (Construction)

**Client Request**: "I want to start construction business"

**Foreign Ownership Limit**:
- **Non-ASEAN countries**: 67% maximum
- **ASEAN countries**: 70% maximum
- **Must have Indonesian partner**: 30-33%

**Example Company Structure (Non-ASEAN)**:
```
PT Construction Indonesia
Authorized Capital: IDR 50B

Shareholder 1 (Foreign - Australia): 67% = IDR 33.5B
Shareholder 2 (Indonesian): 33% = IDR 16.5B

Board Structure:
- Director 1: Foreign (appointed by foreign shareholder)
- Director 2: Indonesian (appointed by Indonesian shareholder)
- Commissioner 1: Foreign
- Commissioner 2: Indonesian

Decision-Making (Shareholder Agreement):
- Major decisions (>IDR 1B expenditure): Requires 80% approval (both parties)
- Daily operations (<IDR 1B): Director authority
- Profit distribution: According to shareholding (67% / 33%)
```

**Why Partner is Important**:
- Indonesian partner may have:
  - Local construction experience
  - Government relationships
  - LPJK connections
  - Land access
  - Subcontractor network

**Protection Mechanisms**:
1. **Shareholder Agreement**: Define decision-making rights
2. **Put/Call Options**: Exit strategy if partnership fails
3. **Non-Compete Clause**: Protect business if partner leaves
4. **Deadlock Resolution**: Arbitration clause (BANI)

---

### Scenario 9.3: 49% Foreign Ownership (Courier/Logistics)

**Client Request**: "I want to start courier business in Indonesia"

**Foreign Ownership Limit**: 49% maximum

**Example Company Structure**:
```
PT Express Delivery Indonesia
Authorized Capital: IDR 30B

Shareholder 1 (Foreign - Singapore): 49% = IDR 14.7B
Shareholder 2 (Indonesian): 51% = IDR 15.3B

Legal Control: Indonesian partner has majority (51%)

Business Control Options:
Despite minority shareholding, foreign investor can have control through:

1. Management Agreement:
   - Foreign company provides management services
   - Management fee: 5-10% of revenue
   - Effective operational control

2. Technology License:
   - Foreign company licenses technology/systems
   - Technology fee: 3-5% of revenue
   - Control of core business systems

3. Franchise Agreement:
   - Brand/systems licensed from foreign company
   - Franchise fee: 5-8% of revenue
   - Quality control provisions

4. Shareholder Agreement:
   - Veto rights on major decisions (despite 49% shareholding)
   - Requirement: 80% vote for major decisions
   - Protects minority shareholder

Total Effective Control:
- Legal: 49% shareholding
- Operational: 70-80% through agreements
- Financial: 13-23% additional revenue through fees
```

**Client Risk Assessment**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **High risk**: Indonesian partner has legal majority
‚úÖ **Mitigation**: Strong shareholder + management agreements
‚úÖ **Alternative**: Consider freight forwarding (67% foreign allowed) instead of courier
