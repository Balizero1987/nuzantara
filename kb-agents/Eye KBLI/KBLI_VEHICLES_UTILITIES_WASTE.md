## Pricing Convention — Bali Zero
- Reference: Desktop/BalizeroPricelist2025.txt for service pricing.
- For all simulations and examples in this document, pricing is set to “Bali Zero” (IDR 0) by default.
- Regulatory fees and mandatory certification costs may still be referenced for awareness, but example totals adopt Bali Zero.
- Replace with real vendor quotes during implementation.

## Notes & Compliance
- Utilities and waste: high compliance burden; AMDAL often mandatory; continuous monitoring (air, water, noise) and reporting.
- PPP/Concessions: water/sewerage may require regional concessions with tariff oversight.
- Defense/Traditional carve‑outs: specific sub‑activities (military aircraft; traditional wooden ships) carry ownership constraints.
