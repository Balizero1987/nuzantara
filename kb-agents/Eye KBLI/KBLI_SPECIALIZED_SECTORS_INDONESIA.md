3. **Guard Certification Mandatory**: Every single guard must have valid Gada Pratama certification - non-negotiable

4. **Background Checks Required**: All security personnel must pass criminal background check (SKCK from police)

5. **Labor-Intensive Business**: Security services are labor-heavy - BPJS (health + employment insurance) mandatory for all guards at minimum wage

6. **Liability Insurance**: Must have insurance covering guard actions - claims for guard misconduct can be substantial

7. **Regulatory Oversight**: Security companies subject to surprise inspections by Ministry of Home Affairs

8. **Cannot Use Foreign Guards**: All security personnel must be Indonesian nationals - foreigners can only be in management roles
