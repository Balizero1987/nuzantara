**Examples**: **Higher Capital Requirements**: ### Realistic Investment Estimates (Excluding Land/Buildings) | KBLI Category | Low End | High End | Notes |\n|---------------|---------|----------|-------| ### Timeline to Operations | Risk Level | Timeline | Notes |\n|------------|----------|-------|\n| **Low (R)** | 6-8 months | NIB only (self-declaration), fastest |\n| **Medium-Low (MR)** | 8-10 months | NIB + Standard Certificate (self-declaration) |\n| **Medium-High (MT)** | 10-14 months | NIB + Standard Certificate (verified) |\n| **High (T)** | 14-36 months | NIB + Standard Certificate + Operating License + AMDAL (environmental assessment) | **Fastest Setups** (6-8 months):\n- KBLI 1392 (Made-up textiles - bedding, towels)\n- KBLI 1394 (Cordage, rope)\n- KBLI 1623 (Wooden containers) **Slowest Setups** (24-36 months):\n- KBLI 1200 (Tobacco - excise licensing)\n- KBLI 1313 (Textile finishing - AMDAL)\n- KBLI 1511 (Leather tanning - AMDAL)\n- KBLI 1621 (Veneer/Panels - AMDAL)\n- KBLI 1701 (Pulp/Paper - AMDAL + construction) --- ## COMMON MISTAKES & WARNINGS ### ❌ Mistake #1: Ignoring SVLK for Wood Products\n**Problem**: Operating wood manufacturing (KBLI 16xxx) without SVLK (Timber Legality Verification)\n**Consequence**:\n- Business shutdown\n- Criminal prosecution (illegal logging penalties: imprisonment + fines)\n- Export ban\n- Blacklisting\n**Solution**:\n- Apply for SVLK **immediately** after NIB issuance\n- Ensure all timber sourced has legal verification\n- Keep wood sourcing documentation for 5 years ### ❌ Mistake #2: Underestimating Environmental Compliance Costs\n**High-Risk KBLIs**:\n**Solution**:\n- Budget **additional 30-50%** for High (T) risk KBLIs\n- Consult environmental engineer **before** site selection\n- Include AMDAL costs in initial capital planning ### ❌ Mistake #3: Attempting 100% Foreign Ownership for Tobacco\n**Problem**: Applying for KBLI 1200 (Tobacco) with 100% foreign ownership\n**Consequence**: NIB application **rejected** by OSS system\n**Solution**:\n- Partner with Indonesian shareholder (minimum 33%)\n- Structure shareholder agreement clearly\n- Consider Joint Venture (JV) or nominee structure (risky - see below) ### ❌ Mistake #4: Missing Excise License (NPPBKC) for Tobacco\n**Problem**: Setting up tobacco manufacturing without NPPBKC (Excise License)\n**Consequence**: Cannot sell products (all tobacco requires excise stamps)\n**Timeline Impact**: NPPBKC application takes 6-12 months\n**Solution**: Apply for NPPBKC **in parallel** with NIB (not sequentially) ### ❌ Mistake #5: E-commerce Retail Strategy for Textiles/Apparel\n**Problem**: Foreign investor plans to manufacture + sell online via e-commerce\n**Legal Issue**: PR 49/2021 - Online retail of textiles, apparel, footwear **reserved for SMEs**\n**Consequence**: E-commerce platform account blocked, business closed\n**Solution**:\n- Manufacture (100% foreign) ✅\n- Wholesale to distributors (100% foreign) ✅\n- Partner with local SME for online retail ✅\n- OR focus on export market ✅ ### ❌ Mistake #6: Combining Unrelated KBLI Codes\n**Problem**: Combining KBLI 1410 (Apparel) + KBLI 2399 (Non-metallic mineral products) + KBLI 6910 (Legal services)\n**Consequence**: OSS rejects application (unrelated business activities raise red flags)\n**Solution**:\n- Only combine **related** KBLIs (e.g., 1311 textile spinning + 1312 textile weaving + 1313 textile finishing = vertically integrated textile mill)\n- Maximum 3-5 KBLI codes recommended ### ❌ Mistake #7: Using KBLI 2017 or 2015 Codes\n**Problem**: Applying with outdated KBLI codes (system requires KBLI 2020)\n**Consequence**: NIB application rejected\n**Solution**:\n- Always use **KBLI 2020** codes (5-digit format)\n- Check oss.go.id for latest KBLI list\n- Some codes were renumbered (e.g., old KBLI 1810 → new KBLI 1701) ### ❌ Mistake #8: Insufficient Paid-Up Capital\n**Problem**: Stating IDR 10B investment but only paying IDR 2.5B paid-up capital\n**Legal Requirement**: Paid-up capital must be **at least 25%** of total investment plan\n**Consequence**: Immigration (work visa KITAS for directors) may reject; BKPM audit issues\n**Solution**: Pay minimum IDR 2.5B paid-up capital **before** KITAS application ### ❌ Mistake #9: Ignoring SNI Certification Deadlines\n**Problem**: Manufacturing products without mandatory SNI, planning to get SNI \"later\"\n**Consequence**: Cannot sell products domestically; customs blocks exports\n**SNI Mandatory for**:\n- Textiles (certain fabrics, garments)\n- Footwear (safety shoes, children's footwear)\n- Wood products (plywood, MDF)\n- Paper products (tissue, toilet paper)\n**Solution**: Apply for SNI certification **in parallel** with factory setup (testing takes 3-6 months) ### ❌ Mistake #10: Nominee Structure for Tobacco\n**Problem**: Using Indonesian \"nominee\" shareholder (100% foreign control, but 33% nominee on paper)\n**Legal Issue**: **ILLEGAL** under Indonesian law (UU 25/2007 Investment Law)\n**Consequence**:\n- Company dissolution\n- Criminal prosecution (fraud)\n- Deportation + blacklist for foreign directors\n- **0% success rate** in disputes\n**Solution**:\n- Structure **genuine partnership** with Indonesian shareholder\n- Use shareholder agreement (legal) with clear rights/responsibilities\n- Consider Put/Call option agreements (legal exit mechanism) --- ## QUICK REFERENCE TABLES ### Table 1: Risk Level Summary | KBLI Code | Description | Risk Level | Timeline | Environmental Permit?
