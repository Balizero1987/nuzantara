## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Sessions)

### Immediate
1. ❌ **TODO**: Update Eye KBLI agent code to reference KBLI_COMPREHENSIVE_SECTOR_GUIDE_2025.md
2. ❌ **TODO**: Test agent queries (e.g., "Can I open a restaurant with 100% foreign ownership?")
3. ❌ **TODO**: Add methods to agent:
   - `getSectorGuide(sector: string)` → return sector-specific rules
   - `checkForeignOwnership(kbli: string)` → return % allowed
   - `getCommonMistakes()` → return top 5 KBLI errors

### Short-term
1. Upload KBLI KB documents to ChromaDB for RAG queries
2. Test RAG queries with updated Eye KBLI agent
3. Create Eye KBLI scraper (eye-kbli-scraper.ts → oss.go.id)

### Medium-term
1. Integrate Eye KBLI agent with RAG backend (Python)
2. Create KBLI code validator (check if code is valid in KBLI 2020)
3. Create capital calculator tool (IDR 10B × KBLI count × location count)
