# Nuzantara Deployment Protocol

Use this skill when deploying to Railway or Google Cloud, or when user asks to push to production.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### 1. Build Validation
```bash
# TypeScript backend build
npm run build

# Verify no TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck
```

Expected: Clean build with no errors.

### 2. Test Suite Execution
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
npm test

# Ensure 70% coverage threshold met
npm run test:coverage
```

Expected: All tests pass, coverage >= 70%.

### 3. Lint & Format Check
```bash
# Check code style (if configured)
npm run lint
```

Expected: No linting errors.

### 4. Environment Variables Validation
Verify all required env vars are set in Railway/Cloud:

**Backend TypeScript (Port 8080)**:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=8080`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `REDIS_URL` (optional)
- `CLOUDFLARE_R2_*` (storage)

**Backend RAG (Port 8000)**:
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `CHROMA_DB_PATH=/data/chroma`
- `EMBEDDING_MODEL=sentence-transformers/...`
- `POSTGRES_URL`
- `TIER_ACCESS_ENABLED=true`

## Deployment Process

### Step 1: Git Operations
```bash
# Ensure we're on the correct branch
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "deploy: [description]

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"

# Push to deployment branch
git push -u origin claude/document-skills-info-011CUQ9yv4uJ4AzJ511d3EUu
```

### Step 2: Railway Deployment
Railway auto-deploys on push if configured. Monitor:

```bash
# Check deployment status (if Railway CLI installed)
railway status

# View logs
railway logs
```

**Alternative: Manual Deploy Script**
```bash
./scripts/deploy/deploy-backend.sh
```

### Step 3: Docker Build (if manual)
```bash
# Build TypeScript backend
cd apps/backend-ts
docker build -t nuzantara-backend-ts:latest .

# Build Python RAG backend
cd apps/backend-rag/backend
docker build -t nuzantara-backend-rag:latest .
```

### Step 4: Health Checks
Wait 60-90 seconds for services to start, then verify:

```bash
# Backend TypeScript health check
curl https://your-railway-domain.railway.app/health

# Backend RAG health check
curl https://your-rag-domain.railway.app/health
```

Expected response: `{"status": "healthy"}` or similar.

### Step 5: Smoke Tests
Run critical path tests:

1. **Auth Test**: Login endpoint works
2. **RAG Test**: Semantic search returns results
3. **Oracle Agent Test**: At least one agent responds
4. **Database Test**: Can read/write to PostgreSQL

### Step 6: Monitoring Setup
Verify monitoring is active:
- Railway dashboard shows green status
- Logs are streaming properly
- No immediate errors in logs
- Memory/CPU usage within normal range

## Rollback Procedure

If health checks fail or critical issues found:

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD

# Force push to trigger redeployment
git push -f origin [branch]
```

Or use Railway dashboard to rollback to previous deployment.

## Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Functional Tests
- Login/logout works
- Chat interface responds
- RAG queries return results
- Oracle agents accessible
- Dashboard loads correctly

### 2. Performance Check
- API response times < 500ms
- RAG query latency acceptable
- No memory leaks
- Database connections stable

### 3. User Notification
Inform team that deployment is complete and system is healthy.

## Key Files
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration
- `apps/backend-ts/Dockerfile` - TS backend container
- `apps/backend-rag/backend/Dockerfile` - RAG backend container
- `scripts/deploy/deploy-backend.sh` - Deployment script
- `docs/deployment/` - Deployment documentation

## Common Issues
- **Build fails**: Check TypeScript errors, missing dependencies
- **Health check timeout**: Services may need more startup time
- **Database connection error**: Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
- **ChromaDB not found**: Ensure data volume is mounted correctly
- **API keys invalid**: Verify environment variables in Railway

## Success Criteria
âœ… All tests pass before deployment
âœ… Build completes successfully
âœ… Both services deploy without errors
âœ… Health checks return 200 OK
âœ… Smoke tests pass
âœ… No errors in production logs
âœ… Previous version can be rolled back if needed

## Emergency Contacts
If deployment fails critically:
1. Rollback immediately
2. Check Railway logs for errors
3. Notify team in Slack/communication channel
4. Document issue for post-mortem
