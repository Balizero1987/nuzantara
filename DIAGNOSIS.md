# üîç ZANTARA Diagnosis - Query Processing Failure

## Issues Identified

### 1. All Queries Return Same Welcome Message
**Symptom:** Every query gets identical response regardless of content
**Tests Failed:** 0/6 passed
- "ciao" ‚Üí Welcome message  
- "quanto costa PT PMA" ‚Üí Welcome message
- "D12 visa" ‚Üí Welcome message

### 2. Output Too Fragmented
**Symptom:** Too many paragraph breaks, hard to read
**User Feedback:** "troppo spezzettato, fa venire mal di testa"

## Root Cause Analysis

The backend IS receiving queries and responding, but Claude Haiku is stuck returning the same greeting response. This suggests:

1. **Conversation history not working** - backend treats every message as new conversation
2. **Memory/context not being passed** - AI doesn't see previous messages
3. **Routing stuck** - queries classified wrong, always triggering welcome

## Solutions Needed

### Priority 1: Fix Query Processing
- Check conversation history handling in `main_cloud.py`
- Verify queries are being passed to Claude correctly
- Check if there's a caching issue

### Priority 2: Fix Output Formatting  
- Reduce paragraph breaks in responses
- Make output more "gradual and pleasant"
- Less fragmented text

## Quick Test Commands

To test Railway backend directly:
```bash
curl -X POST "https://scintillating-kindness-production-47e3.up.railway.app/bali-zero/chat" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"What is 2+2?","user_email":"test@test.com"}' \
  --max-time 30
```

Expected: Answer "4"
Actual: Welcome message

## Next Steps

1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify conversation_history parameter is being used
3. Test with simple queries to isolate issue
4. Fix Claude Haiku system prompt if needed
