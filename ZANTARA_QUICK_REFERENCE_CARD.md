## 🛡️ COMMON RISKS TO WARN CLIENTS ABOUT

1. **Overstay**: Even 1 day = 6-month ban (61+ days = deportation)
2. **Nominee Structure**: Legally grey, high risk, not recommended
3. **Alcohol License**: Major bottleneck for F&B, start EARLY
4. **Capital Proof**: Must be real (not borrowed), verified by notary
5. **Zoning Violations**: Green zone = no commercial (check first!)
6. **Work Permit**: KITAS ≠ work permit (different process)
7. **Tax Residency**: 183+ days/year = Indonesian tax resident
8. **Property Freehold**: ZERO foreigner freehold (leasehold only)

**Psychology**: Warning = "They're protecting me" = Client loyalty

   - "I think..." = Opinion (questionable)
   - "According to Law X..." = Fact (accepted)

4. **Risk Warnings = Loyalty**

   - Client sees partner, not vendor

5. **Language = Comfort**
   - Native language = Emotional connection
   - English client gets English = "They understand me"

**"Isn't this just Google?"**
→ "Google gives 1 million results. ZANTARA gives THE answer with legal citation."

**"Client will think I don't know anything"**
