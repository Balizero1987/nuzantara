The YLI Foundation is supported by several partners including major companies in Indonesia. It has developed hundreds of Indonesian students from leading universities—and is now expanding the reach across 25 universities nationwide and overseas.\nWhen crisis strikes, we play our part in helping public and social institutions respond. In the aftermath of the 2004 earthquake in Aceh, we contributed our management expertise to improve the impact of recovery measures—and strengthen Indonesia’s future resilience, by supporting the government of Indonesia through the establishment of Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR), a special agency formed by the President focusing on disaster management.\n## Our Location\n#### Jakarta\nWisma GKBI 40th Floor Jl.
