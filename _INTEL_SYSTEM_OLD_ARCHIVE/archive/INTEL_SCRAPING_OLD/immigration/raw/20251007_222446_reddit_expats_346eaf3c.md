Please excuse me if I come across a bit rough in my writing. I arrived in France in 2015 to follow my French wife from Korea. As someone who didn‚Äôt know what life as a foreigner was like, I‚Äôve come to realize how much I took the good things in my life for granted before. We pay 1,510 euros a month in rent for a 70m¬≤ place. But I can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs not enough to live safely. Once I got a job here, I started taking the subway, but I couldn‚Äôt stand seeing shit in the station. When I had to take it late at night because of overtime, I even saw drug users. That‚Äôs why I bought a car. Driving made life bearable. But one day, someone smashed one of my side mirrors and ran off. I installed a dashcam like Koreans do to prepare for that kind of crap. A few months later, a thief broke my car window and stole the dashcam. And the car was parked in an underground parking lot, not outside. Plus, I don‚Äôt live in one of those so-called ‚Äúzones‚Äù in French that are considered dangerous or some shithole. Why would I pay 1,510 euros for that? That motherfucker was caught a year later, and I was kind of surprised that the police in France could even catch a petty criminal like that. And yesterday, I was about to go through a green light when a guy in a tracksuit ignored the red pedestrian signal. I slammed on the brakes, but I didn‚Äôt honk‚ÄîI just grimaced and raised my hands. Then this guy yelled some ‚Äúching chang‚Äù crap at me and threw a water bottle at my car. My friend said I was stupid for making that gesture. But what should I have done? Should I have just smiled dumbly and waved? South Koreans work too much, drink a lot, materialism, plastic surgery‚Äîwhatever you say. For me, big cities in France feel like horror movies. As I love my wife and son, I accept that I can‚Äôt go back to Korea. I read a comment that said: ‚ÄúYeah, there‚Äôs differences between countries but ‚Äòliterally afraid to go outside alone‚Äô in Germany or France probably just means you were too poor to live in a good area and you don‚Äôt have that problem in Asia.‚Äù Yeah, I‚Äôm not rich. But so what? At least I think I pay enough to live safely. How much more do I need to pay for a safe place? 2,000? 3,000? I doubt it‚Äôs worth it‚Ä¶  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1o0c23q/i_disagree_with_the_idea_that_people_talking/)

[ Introduced bill to revoke passports and facilitate return to the U.S.?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1nme4ot/introduced_bill_to_revoke_passports_and/)
[ u/capt_b_b_ ](https://www.reddit.com/user/capt_b_b_/)
‚Ä¢ 17 gg fa [ Introduced bill to revoke passports and facilitate return to the U.S.? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1nme4ot/introduced_bill_to_revoke_passports_and/) [ Visa / Citizenship  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/?f=flair_name%3A%22Visa%20%2F%20Citizenship%22) [ The introduced bill H.R. 5300 says that passports for people who support terrorist groups can be revoked or denied. But it seems that everything is a "terrorist group" lately.  There's also a paragraph that says that to return someone to the U.S., a passport that only grants travel back to the U.S. can be issued, or a limited passport.  If this bill comes to pass, how could this affect us ex-pats? Can they invalidate our passports remotely? It's a bit worrying.  It's on page 43 and 44 of the bill. There's a pdf online but I can't post links or photos on this sub.  Edit: as someone pointed out, section 226 has been revoked from the proposed bill!  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1nme4ot/introduced_bill_to_revoke_passports_and/)

[ Return to UK? How?  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1o0955p/return_to_uk_how/)
[ u/Archi-the-doggo ](https://www.reddit.com/user/Archi-the-doggo/)
‚Ä¢ 6 h fa [ Return to UK? How? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1o0955p/return_to_uk_how/) [ Hello! 10 years ago I left the UK after living there for almost 4 years. Since then I traveled around Europe (I am EU and US citizen) but I never felt as at home as I did back in the UK. There is this longing that grows the more I try to find another place to settle. Due to the Brexit it‚Äôs almost impossible to return- also I don‚Äôt work in an industry that easily issues sponsorships (marketing). Also I‚Äôm not really working in that field anymore, I hold degrees and work experience but that‚Äôs kind of the past.  Everytime I try to find a new place or exciting perspective it takes max 6 weeks until this longing comes back. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just nostalgia ‚Ä¶ because I tried to settle elsewhere and I never felt the same degree of belonging.  Any advice or similar experiences?  Have a nice day üåª  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1o0955p/return_to_uk_how/)

##  Do some basic research first. Know if you're eligible to move to country before asking questions. 
If you are currently not an expat, and are looking for information about emigrating, you are required to ask specific questions about a specific destination or set of destinations. You must provide context for your questions which may be relevant. No one is an expert in your eligibility to emigrate, so it‚Äôs expected that you will have an idea of what countries you might be able to get a visa for.
