10:T3958,<h1>OSS 2.0: The Migration Deadline That Locked Out Thousands</h1>
<p><strong>October 5th, 2025 wasn&#39;t just another date. It was the day Indonesia&#39;s business licensing system fundamentally changed—and companies that missed the migration found themselves frozen out of permits, renewals, and government services.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>What Actually Happened</h2>
<p>Indonesia&#39;s Online Single Submission (OSS) system has been the backbone of business licensing since 2018. Version 1.0 streamlined what used to require dozens of agency visits into a single digital portal.</p>
<p>Then came OSS 2.0—a complete rebuild designed to integrate with Indonesia&#39;s expanding digital infrastructure (NIB, LKPM, KBLI updates, SME partnerships). The government announced the migration window in early 2025: <strong>all businesses must manually migrate by October 5th</strong>.</p>
<p>No auto-migration. No grace period. No exceptions.</p>
<p>Companies that missed the deadline? Their OSS 1.0 accounts became read-only. They could see old data but couldn&#39;t:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit annual LKPM reports (required for all companies)</li>
<li>Apply for new licenses or permits</li>
<li>Update business activities (KBLI codes)</li>
<li>Process export/import approvals</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, their businesses were regulatory ghosts—existing on paper but unable to interact with the system.</p>
<p><img src="/instagram/oss-article-image.jpg" alt="OSS 2.0 Migration Deadline">
<em>OSS 2.0 migration deadline notification and system interface</em></p>
<h2>Why the Government Forced Migration</h2>
<p>OSS 2.0 isn&#39;t just a facelift. It&#39;s structural:</p>
<h3><strong>1. KBLI Code Overhaul</strong></h3>
<p>Indonesia&#39;s business activity classification system (KBLI) was completely reorganized in 2024. Old codes? Deprecated. Companies had to manually re-select appropriate codes under the new taxonomy.</p>
<h3><strong>2. SME Partnership Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>Foreign-owned companies (PT PMA) in certain sectors now must formalize partnerships with Indonesian SMEs. OSS 2.0 enforces this by requiring documented partnerships before license renewals.</p>
<h3><strong>3. LKPM Integration</strong></h3>
<p>The annual company activity report (LKPM) is now tightly integrated with OSS 2.0. Failure to file LKPM blocks all other OSS functions—creating a hard dependency.</p>
<h3><strong>4. Real-Time Compliance Tracking</strong></h3>
<p>OSS 2.0 talks to tax, customs, labor, and environmental agencies in real-time. Non-compliance in one area now automatically flags across all agencies.</p>
<p>&quot;OSS 2.0 is Indonesia&#39;s move toward proactive enforcement,&quot; explained Rina Setiawan, corporate compliance advisor in Jakarta. &quot;In OSS 1.0, you could often delay filings or operate in grey areas. OSS 2.0 doesn&#39;t allow that.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Migration Actually Required</h2>
<p>The government made it sound simple: &quot;Log in to OSS 2.0, confirm your data, done.&quot; Reality was messier.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: KBLI Code Re-Verification</strong></h3>
<p>Your old business activities had to be mapped to new KBLI codes. Sounds automatic—wasn&#39;t. Many codes split into subcategories or merged. Companies had to research which new codes matched their operations.</p>
<p><strong>Error here? Your NIB becomes invalid.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Document Re-Upload</strong></h3>
<p>Founding documents, shareholder agreements, domicile letters, director IDs—everything needed re-upload in OSS 2.0 format. Some required notarization updates.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: SME Partnership Documentation (if applicable)</strong></h3>
<p>Foreign companies in manufacturing, F&amp;B distribution, retail, and several other sectors had to upload:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed SME partnership agreements</li>
<li>Proof of partnership implementation</li>
<li>Beneficiary SME tax registration (NPWP)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No partnership? Migration blocked.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: LKPM Filing Sync</strong></h3>
<p>If your 2024 LKPM wasn&#39;t filed, OSS 2.0 wouldn&#39;t activate. You had to clear that first.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 5: Final Validation</strong></h3>
<p>Government verification took 5-14 days. During this window, you couldn&#39;t edit anything. If validation failed, you started over—but the clock kept ticking toward October 5th.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Positif Fiktif Principle: Indonesia&#39;s Silent Approval Rule</h2>
<p>Here&#39;s a legal concept most foreign business owners have never heard of—but should: <strong>Positif Fiktif</strong> (positive deemed approval).</p>
<p>Under Indonesian administrative law (specifically <strong>UU No. 11/2020</strong> on Job Creation), if a government agency fails to respond to a permit or license application within the legally mandated timeframe, <strong>the application is automatically deemed approved</strong>.</p>
<p>Think of it as Indonesia&#39;s anti-bureaucracy failsafe. It was designed to prevent endless delays where companies submitted applications and then... waited. Forever. With no response, no rejection, no approval—just bureaucratic limbo.</p>
<h3><strong>How Positif Fiktif Works in OSS 2.0</strong></h3>
<p>OSS 2.0 integrates Positif Fiktif directly into the licensing workflow. Here&#39;s the timeline:</p>
<p><strong>Standard OSS 2.0 Permit Processing</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>You submit a license application through OSS 2.0</li>
<li>The system assigns it to the relevant agency (investment board, trade ministry, local district office)</li>
<li>The agency has <strong>3-7 working days</strong> (depending on license type) to approve, request clarifications, or reject</li>
<li>If Day 7 passes with no action? <strong>Automatic approval</strong> (Positif Fiktif kicks in)</li>
</ol>
<p>The system issues the license automatically, and the agency legally cannot reverse it without filing an administrative appeal—which requires documented justification.</p>
<h3><strong>Why This Matters for Companies</strong></h3>
<p>Positif Fiktif fundamentally shifts power dynamics. Instead of companies chasing agencies for responses, the burden is on the government to act within deadlines.</p>
<p>For OSS 2.0 migration and permit renewals, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No more &quot;we&#39;re still reviewing&quot;</strong>: After 7 days, silence = approval</li>
<li><strong>Documented timeline protection</strong>: You can prove your application was submitted on Day 1 and auto-approved on Day 8</li>
<li><strong>Legal recourse</strong>: If an agency tries to block an auto-approved permit, you have grounds for administrative challenge</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Positif Fiktif changed everything for foreign investors,&quot; said Dr. Hadi Susanto, administrative law professor at Universitas Indonesia. &quot;Before, agencies could delay indefinitely. Now, delay means approval. It&#39;s forced efficiency.&quot;</p>
<h3><strong>The Catch (There&#39;s Always a Catch)</strong></h3>
<p>Positif Fiktif only applies if:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Your application is complete</strong>: Missing documents? The clock doesn&#39;t start until you submit everything.</li>
<li><strong>It&#39;s a qualifying license</strong>: Some high-risk permits (environmental impact assessments, mining licenses) are exempt and require explicit approval.</li>
<li><strong>No legal violations</strong>: If your application contains fraudulent information or violates zoning laws, Positif Fiktif doesn&#39;t protect you from post-approval sanctions.</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Real-World Example</strong></h3>
<p>A Jakarta-based PT PMA submitted an OSS 2.0 business activity expansion in March 2025—adding two new KBLI codes for e-commerce distribution. The local trade office was supposed to verify within 5 working days.</p>
<p>Day 6, day 7, day 8—no response.</p>
<p>On Day 9, OSS 2.0 automatically issued the updated NIB with the new activities. The trade office later sent a &quot;request for additional documentation&quot; letter—two weeks after Positif Fiktif kicked in.</p>
<p>The company&#39;s response? &quot;We appreciate the request, but our license was already auto-approved under Positif Fiktif. The system confirms approval on [date]. If you have concerns, please file an administrative review.&quot;</p>
<p>The office never responded again. The license stood.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Use Positif Fiktif Strategically</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Submit complete applications</strong>: Don&#39;t give agencies an excuse to delay the clock.</li>
<li><strong>Document everything</strong>: Screenshot submission timestamps, system confirmations, automated emails.</li>
<li><strong>Track deadlines religiously</strong>: Know when Positif Fiktif applies—Day 7 for most permits.</li>
<li><strong>Invoke it confidently</strong>: If you&#39;re past the deadline, state explicitly: &quot;This application is deemed approved under Positif Fiktif as of [date], per OSS 2.0 automated confirmation.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Positif Fiktif isn&#39;t a loophole—it&#39;s Indonesian law. And it&#39;s one of the few regulations that actually works in favor of businesses instead of bureaucrats.</p>

<em>Professional business compliance work - OSS 2.0 represents Indonesia&#39;s shift toward automated regulatory processes</em></p>
<h2>What Happened to Companies That Missed It</h2>
<p>By October 6th, <strong>an estimated 47,000 businesses</strong> (mostly SMEs and foreign-owned PT PMAs) had not completed OSS 2.0 migration. The consequences were immediate:</p>
<h3><strong>Frozen License Renewals</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>TDP (company registration) renewals: blocked</li>
<li>Industry-specific permits (health, tourism, F&amp;B): blocked</li>
<li>Environmental clearances: blocked</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Export/Import Paralysis</strong></h3>
<p>Companies reliant on import licenses for raw materials or export approvals for goods found themselves unable to process new shipments. For manufacturers, this meant production halts within weeks.</p>
<h3><strong>LKPM Submission Impossible</strong></h3>
<p>The 2025 LKPM filing deadline (April 30, 2026) requires OSS 2.0 access. Non-migrated companies faced a paradox: they couldn&#39;t migrate without filing LKPM, but couldn&#39;t file LKPM without migrating.</p>
<h3><strong>Banking &amp; Tax Issues</strong></h3>
<p>Some companies reported banks flagging their accounts due to &quot;irregular NIB status&quot; (OSS 2.0 sync issues). Tax offices requested proof of OSS 2.0 migration during audits.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Post-Deadline Scramble</h2>
<p>After October 5th, the Ministry of Investment opened a &quot;special remediation window&quot; for non-migrated companies—but with penalties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Administrative fines: ₹5-15 million (depending on company size)</li>
<li>Mandatory compliance audit before migration approval</li>
<li>30-day processing time (vs. 5-14 days during normal window)</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;We had clients who ignored our August reminders,&quot; said Budi Santoso, corporate services manager at a Jakarta consultancy. &quot;Post-deadline, their migration took six weeks and cost triple. One lost a major export contract because they couldn&#39;t process shipment approvals.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why So Many Companies Missed It</h2>
<p>Three reasons:</p>
<h3><strong>1. Information Overload</strong></h3>
<p>The Ministry issued guidance updates almost monthly between January and September 2025. Many company directors, especially smaller PT PMAs, couldn&#39;t keep up with requirement changes.</p>
<h3><strong>2. Language Barriers</strong></h3>
<p>OSS 2.0 portal is Indonesian-only. Foreign directors without local consultants often misunderstood steps or submitted incorrect documentation.</p>
<h3><strong>3. &quot;It&#39;ll Get Extended&quot; Assumption</strong></h3>
<p>Indonesia has a history of extending regulatory deadlines. Many companies gambled on an extension announcement. It never came.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Ongoing Impact</h2>
<p>OSS 2.0 fundamentally changed how Indonesian businesses operate. It&#39;s not just about migration—it&#39;s about a <strong>permanently more stringent compliance environment</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Quarterly Reporting</strong></h3>
<p>OSS 2.0 enables agencies to request quarterly updates, not just annual LKPM. Expect more frequent data submissions.</p>
<h3><strong>Automated Sanctions</strong></h3>
<p>Missed filings trigger automatic penalties. No warning letters, no grace periods—straight to sanctions.</p>
<h3><strong>Cross-Agency Visibility</strong></h3>
<p>Labor Ministry sees your tax filings. Environmental agency sees your import records. Everything is connected. Non-compliance in one area cascades everywhere.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Companies Should Do Now</h2>
<p>If you migrated successfully: <strong>Monitor your OSS 2.0 dashboard regularly.</strong> The system now sends compliance alerts, renewal reminders, and document expiration warnings. Ignoring them has immediate consequences.</p>
<p>If you haven&#39;t migrated: <strong>Act immediately.</strong> The post-deadline process is expensive and slow, but waiting longer only compounds problems.</p>
