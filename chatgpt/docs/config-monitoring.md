# Configuration Monitoring

A dedicated monitoring dashboard should be set up to track configuration changes and application health.

## Key Metrics to Monitor:

*   **Configuration Load/Reload Events:** Track when the configuration is loaded or hot-reloaded.
*   **Errors:** Monitor for any errors related to configuration loading or validation.
*   **Application Performance:** Correlate configuration changes with application performance metrics (e.g., response time, error rate).
*   **Secret Access:** If using a secret management service, monitor access to secrets.
