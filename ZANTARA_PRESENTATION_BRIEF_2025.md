## HANDLING OBJECTIONS (Preparation)

### **‚ùì OBJECTION 1: "Is this just ChatGPT?"**

### **‚ùì OBJECTION 2: "Can I just Google this?"**

### **‚ùì OBJECTION 3: "What if ZANTARA is wrong?"**

**Answer**:
"ZANTARA is trained on official laws and our verified case history. But it's a TOOL, not a replacement for us. We verify important details, we handle the actual applications, we take responsibility. ZANTARA makes us FASTER and MORE ACCURATE, but YOU still get human expertise and accountability."

### **üìù STORY TEMPLATE 1: The Speed Win**

"Client called at 9am asking about investor KITAS requirements for his PT PMA. Before ZANTARA, I would need to check our files, maybe call the office, get back to him by afternoon.

With ZANTARA, I typed his question, got complete answer in 5 seconds - visa type (E28A), cost (17jt offshore), timeline (30-45 days), all required documents, legal basis. I sent him complete proposal by 9:15am.

He replied: 'This is the fastest quote I've ever received. Let's proceed.'

Deal closed before lunch. ZANTARA paid for itself on day one."

### **üìù STORY TEMPLATE 2: The Authority Win**

"Client was comparing us to cheaper agent. Cheaper agent said 'Tourist visa can be extended indefinitely.' I used ZANTARA, showed client: 'According to Permenkumham No. 27/2014, B211A visa maximum 180 days (60+60+60). Cannot exceed.'

Client saw I cited actual law. Cheaper agent was guessing. Client chose us, said: 'I want someone who knows the law, not someone who guesses.'

Premium price accepted. Because ZANTARA showed we're professionals."

### **üìù STORY TEMPLATE 3: The Risk Warning Win**

"Client wanted to buy villa via nominee structure (cheaper than PT PMA route). ZANTARA warned: 'Nominee structure legally grey area, high risk of disputes, not recommended.'

I showed client the warning, explained the risk honestly. Client appreciated honesty, chose the safe PT PMA route instead. Cost more, but client said: 'You're protecting me, not just selling. That's why I trust you.'

Long-term client relationship secured. Because ZANTARA helped me be honest advisor, not just salesman."
