## Build Decision in 5 Seconds

Ask yourself these questions in order:

1. **Did I change Dockerfile?** → YES = Full rebuild (3-4 min) | NO = Continue ↓
2. **Did I change requirements.txt?** → YES = Partial rebuild (2-3 min) | NO = Continue ↓
3. **Did I only change .py files?** → YES = Fast build (~1 min) | NO = Check guide

## Most Common Scenarios (90% of cases)

| You changed... | Build time | Just push? |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| main_cloud.py | ~45s | ✅ YES |
| Fixed a bug in services/ | ~45s | ✅ YES |
| Added 'import openai' | ~120s | ⚠️ Update requirements.txt first |
| Updated SYSTEM_PROMPT | ~45s | ✅ YES |
| Fixed typo in response | ~45s | ✅ YES |

## Red Flags 🚨 (Need full rebuild)

- Changed Python version (3.11 → 3.12)
- Modified Docker stages
- Added apt-get packages
- Changed model download

## Golden Rules

1. **When in doubt, just push** - Railway is smart
2. **Don't force rebuilds** unless builds fail
3. **Python changes = fast** (this is 90% of work)
4. **Test locally first** if unsure

## The One Command You Need

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "your message" && git push
```

Railway handles the rest! 🚀
