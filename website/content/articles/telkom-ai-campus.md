**Yogyakarta, October 23, 2025** —

Telkom Indonesia has officially launched **AI Campus**, a new national education program designed to train **113,000 young Indonesians** in artificial intelligence (AI), data, and digital technology. The goal is clear: build a generation ready to shape Indonesia's digital future — not just use it.

## What Is AI Campus?

AI Campus is part of **Telkom's AI Center of Excellence (AI CoE)** — a network of universities, companies, and innovation hubs working together to prepare the next generation of tech professionals.

The program connects **education, research, and industry**. Students will learn about AI, data analytics, software development, and machine learning, and then apply what they learn through **real projects** supported by Telkom and its partners.

Instead of focusing only on theory, AI Campus aims to **turn classrooms into labs** — where students solve real business and social problems using AI tools.

## Why It Starts in Yogyakarta

The first AI Campus is being launched at **Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta (UMY)**, one of Indonesia's leading private universities.

Telkom chose Yogyakarta because it's a **student city**, full of creativity and innovation. The partnership with UMY is also the starting point for a **larger network**: other Muhammadiyah universities across Indonesia will soon join the program.

This means that the project is **not limited to Java** — it's designed to reach students across the country, from Sumatra to Sulawesi.

## How It Works

AI Campus will be built on **four main pillars:**

1. **AI Campus** — education, learning programs, and student projects
2. **AI Playground** — experimental labs and sandbox environments for AI practice
3. **AI Connect** — events, hackathons, and job matchmaking with industry partners
4. **AI Hub** — research and development for applied AI use cases

Students will take part in courses, workshops, and internships, guided by mentors from Telkom and local businesses. The best projects will receive **incubation support** — funding, mentorship, and a chance to go commercial.

## The Bigger Vision

According to **Telkom Indonesia**, the project is about more than technology — it's about **building human capital** for the country's digital economy.

By 2030, Indonesia is expected to need **millions of skilled digital workers**, but the education system hasn't kept up with industry demand. AI Campus wants to **fill that gap**, turning universities into production lines for skilled professionals.

"AI Campus will connect classrooms with real industry problems," said one Telkom representative. "It's not just about learning AI — it's about using AI to solve Indonesia's challenges."

## Opportunities and Challenges

Training 113,000 people is a big promise — and a big challenge.

The main concern is **quality control**: how to keep the training deep and practical while scaling across dozens of universities.

To succeed, Telkom and its partners will need to:
- Continuously update the curriculum
- Train the trainers (professors and mentors)
- Ensure equal access outside Java
- Create strong links with companies that can hire these new talents

Still, the initiative marks an important step. It shows that Indonesia is serious about **growing its own AI ecosystem**, instead of importing talent or technology from abroad.

## What It Means for Indonesia

If done well, AI Campus could:
- Make Indonesia a **regional hub for digital innovation**
- Help local industries adopt automation faster
- Create **new job opportunities** in AI and data sectors
- Strengthen collaboration between academia and private companies

It's an investment in the long game — teaching thousands of young people to understand, build, and use the technologies that will define the next decade.

In other words: **Telkom is not just building networks. It's building minds.**
