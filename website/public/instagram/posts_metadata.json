Done right, it unlocks faster approvals and fewer bureaucratic hurdles. \n\nDone wrong, it blocks your business.\n\n📲 DM us on WhatsApp today. \n\nBali Zero checks your KBLI, prepares your files, and completes the OSS 2.0 migration — before the deadline shuts the door.\n\n#OSS2_0 #OSSRBA #OSSMigration #LKPM #PMAIndonesia #KBLI #NIBIndonesia",
