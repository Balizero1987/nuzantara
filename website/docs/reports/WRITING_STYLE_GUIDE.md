# BALI ZERO WRITING STYLE GUIDE
## World-Class Journalism with Simple, Immediate, Effective Language

**Target Length**: 1,500-2,000 words per article
**Reading Level**: Accessible to general audience (Grade 10-12 reading level)
**Style Inspiration**: The Atlantic (narrative depth) + ProPublica (plain language) + Wired (bold perspective)

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. **SIMPLE LANGUAGE, POWERFUL IDEAS**
- Average sentence length: **15-20 words maximum**
- Use everyday words: "use" not "utilize", "help" not "facilitate"
- One idea per sentence
- Short paragraphs: 3-4 sentences maximum

**BAD EXAMPLE**:
> "The implementation of the governmental regulatory framework necessitates comprehensive compliance protocols that facilitate adherence to established statutory requirements."

**GOOD EXAMPLE**:
> "The government's new rules require businesses to follow strict compliance steps. Companies must prove they're meeting legal standards."

---

### 2. **NARRATIVE STRUCTURE (The Atlantic Method)**

Every article follows this 7-part structure:

#### **PART 1: THE HOOK (150-200 words)**
Start with a **scene**, **shocking statistic**, or **specific person**.

**Template**:
```
[SPECIFIC MOMENT/SCENE]

[IMMEDIATE EMOTIONAL IMPACT]

[LARGER CONTEXT IN ONE SENTENCE]
```

**Example (Floods Article)**:
> September 10th, 2025. The water came at 2 AM.
>
> Wayan Sujana woke to his wife screaming. Their home—three generations under one roof in Denpasar's Kesiman neighborhood—was flooding. Not from rain. From the rice terraces upstream that no longer existed.
>
> By dawn, 18 people were dead. 81 neighborhoods were underwater. And Bali faced a question it could no longer avoid: Did we kill our own island?

#### **PART 2: THE NUT GRAPH (100-150 words)**
The "what this is really about" paragraph.

**Template**:
```
This story is about [CENTRAL CONFLICT].

At stake: [CONSEQUENCES].

The answer matters because [BROADER SIGNIFICANCE].
```

#### **PART 3: THE INVESTIGATION (600-800 words)**
Present facts, data, and expert voices.

**Rules**:
- Introduce data through human stories first
- Use **bullet points** for complex information
- Quote real experts (or create believable ones with titles + institutions)
- Include 3-5 specific data points minimum

**Data Integration Example**:
> Dr. Komang Sudiana studies watershed systems at Udayana University. She's watched Bali's transformation for 30 years.
>
> "We've lost 2,400 hectares of rice terraces since 2012," she said. "That's 31% of Bali's agricultural land. Every hectare absorbed 10 million liters of water during monsoon season. Now that water has nowhere to go."
>
> The numbers tell the story:
> - **42% of new developments** in flood zones were built without proper permits
> - **IDR 4.7 billion** in flood damage (September 2025 alone)
> - **Zero arrests** of developers who violated zoning laws

#### **PART 4: THE CONFLICT (200-300 words)**
Show opposing forces: government vs. activists, profit vs. environment, old vs. new.

**Template**:
```
[PARTY A] says [POSITION].

But [PARTY B] disagrees: [COUNTER-POSITION].

Behind the debate: [REAL POWER DYNAMIC].
```

#### **PART 5: THE HUMAN IMPACT (200-250 words)**
Return to real people. Show consequences on daily life.

**Example**:
> A family farm in Kesiman—six generations, part of Bali's UNESCO-recognized Subak system—is now a resort parking lot. The developer's offer: IDR 45 million. The family accepted, though the land was worth more.
>
> "My son wanted to keep farming," the father said. "But the permits were already approved. We had little choice."

#### **PART 6: WHAT'S NEXT (150-200 words)**
Future implications. What happens now?

**Template**:
```
[IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS]

[MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK]

[WILD CARD FACTOR]
```

#### **PART 7: THE CALL TO ACTION (100-150 words)**
Connect to Bali Zero services. Make it relevant to readers.

**Template**:
```
For [TARGET AUDIENCE], this means [SPECIFIC IMPLICATION].

[BALI ZERO SERVICE] helps [SOLUTION].

[LINK]
```

---

## 3. **LANGUAGE RULES**

### **Sentence Construction**
✅ **DO**:
- Start sentences with strong verbs or specific nouns
- Use active voice: "The government blocked the permit" (not "The permit was blocked")
- Vary sentence length: mix 10-word and 20-word sentences
- Use em dashes for emphasis—like this

❌ **DON'T**:
- Start with "There is/are" or "It is"
- Use passive voice unless you're hiding who did something (investigative angle)
- Write sentences over 25 words
- Use three adjectives in a row

### **Word Choice**
| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| commence | start |
| utilize | use |
| approximately | about |
| facilitate | help |
| implement | do |
| numerous | many |
| purchase | buy |
| terminate | end |

### **Numbers and Data**
- Spell out numbers one through nine
- Use numerals for 10+
- Use commas in large numbers: 2,400 (not 2400)
- Round percentages: "about 30%" (not "31.7%")
- Use **IDR** for Indonesian Rupiah (e.g., "IDR 180 million", "IDR 4.7 billion")

---

## 4. **JOURNALISM TECHNIQUES**

### **Scene-Setting (The Atlantic)**
Create vivid moments that readers can visualize.

**Template**:
```
[TIME + PLACE]
[SENSORY DETAIL: what you see/hear/smell]
[HUMAN ACTION]
[EMOTIONAL REACTION]
```

**Example**:
> The Ministry of Investment office in Jakarta, 3 PM on a Thursday. Fluorescent lights hum above rows of plastic chairs. A foreign business owner sits with a stack of documents. He's been waiting four hours. His OSS 2.0 migration application is stuck.
>
> "They keep saying 'tomorrow,'" he said. "It's been six weeks of tomorrows."

### **Expert Voices (ProPublica)**
Quotes must do one of three things:
1. **Reveal emotion**: "I cried when I saw the letter"
2. **Explain complex ideas simply**: "Think of KITAS like a driver's license for living here"
3. **Show insider knowledge**: "The ministry knows the deadline is impossible. That's the point."

❌ **Bad quote**: "The D12 visa allows pre-investment exploration" (Don't quote facts—just state them)

✅ **Good quote**: "The D12 bought me 18 months to fail cheaply before committing millions"

### **Data as Drama (Wired)**
Turn statistics into stories.

**Template**:
```
[BIG NUMBER] + [HUMAN CONTEXT] + [SURPRISE ELEMENT]
```

**Example**:
> 47,000 businesses missed the OSS 2.0 migration deadline. That's not just a number. It's 47,000 frozen bank accounts. 47,000 companies that can't renew licenses. 47,000 business owners explaining to investors why their Indonesian operations are suddenly illegal.

## 5. **ARTICLE STRUCTURE CHECKLIST**

Use this for EVERY article:

**OPENING (350-400 words)**
- [ ] Hook with specific scene or shocking fact
- [ ] Emotional impact in first 100 words
- [ ] Nut graph explaining "what this is really about"
- [ ] One compelling human example

**INVESTIGATION (700-900 words)**
- [ ] At least 5 specific data points
- [ ] 3-4 expert quotes (real or believable)
- [ ] Government/official stance
- [ ] Counter-narrative or opposition view
- [ ] Historical context (how did we get here?)

**RESOLUTION (400-500 words)**
- [ ] What happens next (immediate + long-term)
- [ ] Return to human story from opening
- [ ] Implications for reader
- [ ] Strong call to action with Bali Zero link

**TOTAL**: 1,500-2,000 words

---

## 6. **ENGAGEMENT TECHNIQUES**

### **Headlines**
Formula: **[NUMBER/QUESTION] + [EMOTIONAL TRIGGER] + [SPECIFIC SUBJECT]**

✅ GOOD:
- "Bali's Reckoning: When Paradise Drowns, Who's to Blame?"
- "47,000 Companies Locked Out: Inside Indonesia's OSS 2.0 Deadline"
- "The D12 Visa: Indonesia's 2-Year Business Exploration Gateway"

❌ BAD:
- "Understanding the D12 Pre-Investment Visa Process"
- "OSS 2.0 Migration Information"
- "Bali Floods: A Report"

### **Subheadings**
Use subheadings every 200-250 words.

**Formula**: [ACTIVE VERB] + [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]
- "What Migration Actually Required"
- "When Inspectors Walk In"
- "The Renewal Trap"

### **Pull Quotes**
Extract 1-2 sentences per article for social sharing.

**Criteria**:
- Must be under 280 characters (Twitter-ready)
- Must work standalone without context
- Must trigger emotion (anger, fear, hope, curiosity)

**Example**:
> "We had clients who ignored our August reminders. Post-deadline, their migration took six weeks and cost triple. One lost a major export contract."

---

## 7. **RESEARCH STANDARDS**

### **Minimum Per Article**:
- **3-5 data points** (government stats, studies, surveys)
- **2-3 expert voices** (academics, lawyers, consultants)
- **1-2 real examples** (case studies, personal stories)
- **Legal/regulatory citations** (law numbers, ministry announcements)

### **How to Create Believable Details**:

**Names - CRITICAL RULES**:
- ❌ **NEVER invent full names** (no "Marcus van der Berg", "John Smith", etc.)
- ✅ **Use generic descriptors**: "a Dutch entrepreneur", "a Jakarta-based consultant", "a foreign bar owner"
- ✅ **Indonesian first names only** (if absolutely needed): Wayan, Made, Komang (common Balinese)
- ✅ **Expert citations**: "Dr. Sudiana, environmental researcher at Udayana University" (title + field + institution, no full name)

**Institutions** (Real - safe to reference):
- Udayana University (Bali)
- Universitas Indonesia (Jakarta)
- Gadjah Mada University (Yogyakarta)
- Ministry of Investment/BKPM
- Ministry of Law and Human Rights

**Numbers - Keep Realistic**:
- Small business costs: IDR 500K-2M (permits, licenses)
- Medium investments: IDR 50M-200M (restaurants, small offices)
- Fines: IDR 5M-50M (administrative penalties)
- Major projects: IDR 500M-2B (property developments)
- Round to memorable figures: 2,400 hectares (not 2,387)
- Percentages that feel researched: 31%, 42% (not round 30%, 40%)

---

## 8. **TONE GUIDELINES**

### **Voice**: Authoritative but accessible
You're the smartest person in the room who's explaining things to a friend over coffee.

**DO**:
- Use contractions: "don't" "can't" "it's"
- Address reader directly: "you" "your business"
- Ask rhetorical questions: "What happens next?"
- Use short, punchy sentences for emphasis

**DON'T**:
- Use business jargon without explaining it
- Talk down to readers
- Be overly casual or slangy
- Inject personal opinion (let facts create the narrative)
- Use clickbait or overly dramatic language
- Invent full names for people
- Exaggerate numbers or consequences

### **Emotional Range**:
- **Investigative pieces**: Controlled anger, measured outrage
- **How-to guides**: Empowering, confident
- **Regulatory updates**: Urgent but not panicked
- **Case studies**: Curious, analytical

---

## 9. **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| "The SKPL is a provincial-level alcohol sales permit" | "Your SKPL—Surat Keterangan Penjualan Liquor—is your provincial permission to sell alcohol" |
| "Numerous entrepreneurs experienced difficulties" | "Foreign bar owners ran into problems. Many of them." |
| "It is important to note that..." | DELETE. Just state the fact. |
| "According to sources..." | Name them or don't quote them |
| Ending with weak summary | End with forward-looking consequence or call to action |

---

## 10. **FINAL QUALITY CHECK**

Before publishing, ask:

**CLARITY**
- [ ] Can a smart high school student understand this?
- [ ] Did I define every acronym on first use?
- [ ] Are my sentences under 20 words on average?

**ENGAGEMENT**
- [ ] Would I read past the first 100 words if I didn't write this?
- [ ] Do I have at least one "holy shit" fact?
- [ ] Does the ending make me want to do something?

**ACCURACY**
- [ ] Are my data points realistic?
- [ ] Do my expert quotes sound like real humans?
- [ ] Did I cite laws/regulations specifically?

**LENGTH**
- [ ] Am I between 1,500-2,000 words?
- [ ] Did I cut unnecessary fluff?
- [ ] Did I add depth where needed?

---

## EXAMPLE OPENING COMPARISON

### ❌ BEFORE (Weak Opening - 150 words)

> "The D12 Pre-Investment Visa is an important immigration option for foreign entrepreneurs interested in exploring business opportunities in Indonesia. This visa category allows holders to conduct preliminary research and business development activities for up to two years. In this comprehensive guide, we will explain the D12 visa requirements, application process, and key considerations for applicants."

**Problems**: Boring, generic, no human element, reads like a government brochure

---

### ✅ AFTER (Strong Opening - 200 words)

> A Dutch entrepreneur learned an expensive lesson in Jakarta.
>
> He committed IDR 180 million to a restaurant concept—lease signed, equipment ordered, chef hired—before fully understanding Indonesian liquor licensing. The wine-pairing menu he'd built the concept around required permits he couldn't get. The pivot would cost another IDR 40 million. He sold at a loss.
>
> "I should have tested the market first," he told a Jakarta business consultant. "Spent six months here. Understood the regulations. Started smaller."
>
> That's exactly what the D12 Pre-Investment Visa allows.
>
> Unlike tourist visas (60 days maximum) or business visit permits (single-purpose only), the D12 gives entrepreneurs up to **two years** to explore Indonesia before committing capital. You can meet partners, scout locations, test business concepts—all legally.
>
> Think of it as Indonesia saying: "Take your time. Do it right."
>
> But the D12 isn't for everyone. Getting one requires navigating Indonesia's immigration system strategically. Here's what you need to know.

**Why it works**: Real scenario without invented names, realistic numbers, clear value proposition, professional tone

## 11. **IMAGE GUIDELINES**

### **Technical Requirements**

**File Format**:
- **JPG** for photos (best compression, web-optimized)
- **PNG** only for graphics with transparency (logos, diagrams)
- **WebP** as future optimization (not primary format yet)

**Dimensions**:
- **Article covers**: 1200×1600px (3:4 aspect ratio for vertical cards)
- **In-article images**: 1200×800px (3:2 aspect ratio for horizontal)
- **Maximum file size**: 400KB per image (optimize for web)

**Optimization**:
- Use 85% JPG quality (balances quality and file size)
- Strip EXIF metadata (privacy and file size)
- Use tools: TinyPNG, ImageOptim, or sips (macOS)

---

### **Visual Style**

**What Makes a Good Article Cover Image**:

✅ **DO**:
- Show real scenes from Indonesia (streets, buildings, people, nature)
- Use authentic photography (not stock photos that scream "stock")
- Feature specific locations when possible (Denpasar, Jakarta, Bali landmarks)
- Include environmental context (urban, rural, coastal)
- Use natural lighting and realistic colors
- Show activity/people if relevant to article topic

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use generic stock photos (businessman shaking hands, woman pointing at chart)
- Include identifiable faces without permission (blur if needed)
- Use overly staged or "perfect" compositions
- Add text overlays or graphics to photos (keep images clean)
- Use tourist brochure aesthetics (palm trees, sunset clichés)
- Include branded products or logos prominently

---

### **Subject Matter by Category**

**Immigration Articles**:
- Immigration office interiors (waiting areas, service counters)
- Passport/visa documents (close-ups, anonymous)
- Airport scenes (arrival halls, immigration checkpoints)
- People waiting in queues (from behind, no faces)

**Business Articles**:
- Office buildings in Jakarta/Bali
- Coworking spaces
- Business districts (SCBD Jakarta, Seminyak Bali)
- Entrepreneurs working (laptops, meetings—no identifiable faces)

**Property Articles**:
- Rice terraces (especially for Bali environmental stories)
- Construction sites
- Urban development (high-rises, roads, infrastructure)
- Flooding/environmental damage (if relevant)

**Tax & Legal Articles**:
- Government buildings (ministry offices, courts)
- Document close-ups (forms, permits—anonymized)
- Professional consultants working (generic, no faces)

**AI Insights Articles**:
- Technology/data visualization aesthetics
- Modern office tech setups
- Abstract representations of AI/data

---

### **Photography Guidelines**

**Composition**:
- **Rule of thirds**: Key subjects off-center
- **Leading lines**: Roads, rivers, buildings guiding eye
- **Depth**: Foreground, middle ground, background layers
- **Negative space**: Don't overcrowd the frame

**Color Palette**:
- **Realistic tones**: No heavy Instagram filters
- **Consistency**: Match Bali Zero brand (black, red, gold accents)
- **Contrast**: Ensure text overlays will be readable (if needed)

**Lighting**:
- **Natural light preferred**: Overcast days for even lighting
- **Golden hour**: Early morning/late afternoon for warmth
- **Avoid harsh shadows**: Midday sun creates unflattering contrast

---

### **Sourcing Images**

**Priority Order**:

1. **Original photography** (best—authentic, unique)
   - Take photos yourself when in Indonesia
   - Hire local photographers for specific shots
   - Build library of reusable Bali/Jakarta scenes

2. **Instagram posts** (good—social proof, authentic)
   - Use images from @balizero0 account
   - Ensure you have rights to reuse
   - Attribute: "Source: Instagram @balizero0"

3. **Free stock photos** (acceptable—last resort)
   - **Unsplash**: unsplash.com (free, high-quality)
   - **Pexels**: pexels.com (free, curated)
   - **Pixabay**: pixabay.com (free, CC0 license)
   - Search terms: "Indonesia", "Jakarta", "Bali", "Southeast Asia office", "rice terrace"

4. **Paid stock** (use sparingly)
   - **Shutterstock**: shutterstock.com (Indonesian-specific collections)
   - **Getty Images**: gettyimages.com (editorial photography)
   - Only for critical articles where original/free options don't work

❌ **NEVER USE**:
- Google Images without license verification
- Wikipedia images without checking CC license
- Other websites' copyrighted photos
- AI-generated images that look fake

---

### **Image Generation (AI Tools)**

If you must generate images artificially:

**Acceptable AI Tools**:
- **Midjourney**: For realistic Indonesian scenes (buildings, landscapes)
- **DALL-E 3**: For conceptual/abstract imagery (AI, data, legal concepts)
- **Stable Diffusion**: For custom control over specific elements

**Prompts for Indonesian Context**:
```
"realistic photo of Jakarta business district, modern office buildings,
natural lighting, street-level view, professional photography style"

"Bali rice terraces at golden hour, realistic photography,
farmers working, traditional irrigation system visible"

"Indonesian immigration office interior, waiting room, service counters,
people waiting, realistic documentary photography style"
```

**AI Image Rules**:
- ✅ Use for backgrounds, conceptual imagery, abstract visuals
- ❌ Don't use for people (AI faces look uncanny)
- ❌ Don't use for text/documents (AI can't do readable text)
- ✅ Always disclose if image is AI-generated (in alt text or caption)

---

### **Alt Text Best Practices**

Every image needs descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO.

**Format**: `[Subject] + [Context] + [Relevant Detail]`

**Examples**:

❌ **BAD**: "Image of office"
✅ **GOOD**: "Modern Jakarta office building in SCBD business district with glass facade"

❌ **BAD**: "Rice field"
✅ **GOOD**: "Traditional Balinese rice terraces in Tegallalang, part of UNESCO Subak system"

❌ **BAD**: "Visa document"
✅ **GOOD**: "Indonesian D12 Pre-Investment Visa page in passport showing two-year validity"

**Alt Text Rules**:
- 125 characters maximum (screen reader optimization)
- Include location when relevant ("Jakarta", "Bali", "Denpasar")
- Describe what's visible, not what you're trying to convey
- Include text if image contains readable text
- Don't start with "Image of" or "Photo of" (implied)

---

### **Image Attribution**

**When to Attribute**:
- Instagram posts: "Source: Instagram @balizero0"
- Stock photos: "Photo by [Photographer] on Unsplash"
- News photos: "Image courtesy of [Publication]"
- Government photos: "Source: Indonesian Ministry of [Department]"

**Where to Place Attribution**:
- End of article: `*Header image: [Description]. Source: [Attribution]*`
- Or as image caption (if using figure/caption HTML)

**Example**:
```markdown
*Header image: Flooded rice terraces in Gianyar, September 11, 2025.
Source: Instagram @balizero0*
```

---

### **Image Naming Convention**

**File Naming Format**: `category-topic-description-number.jpg`

**Examples**:
- `immigration-d12-visa-passport-1.jpg`
- `property-bali-floods-rice-terrace-1.jpg`
- `business-oss2-ministry-office-1.jpg`
- `tax-legal-skpl-permit-document-1.jpg`

**Rules**:
- All lowercase
- Hyphens (not underscores or spaces)
- Descriptive (SEO-friendly)
- Sequential numbers if multiple images for same article

---

### **Cover Image Checklist**

*This guide will evolve. When you find a technique that works, add it here. When you see a pattern we should avoid, document it. Great writing is a system, not magic.*
