4:T2b0f,<h1>North Bali Airport: Ten Years of Promises, Still No Runway</h1>
<p><strong>Billions discussed. Consultants hired. Studies commissioned. And Buleleng still waits for the airport that was supposed to change everything.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2>The Dream That Won&#39;t Take Off</h2>
<p>In 2015, Indonesia&#39;s Ministry of Transportation announced a plan that North Bali had been waiting generations to hear: a new international airport in Buleleng regency. The pitch was seductive. <strong>Ngurah Rai International Airport</strong>, Bali&#39;s only commercial gateway, was choking on 27 million passengers annually in facilities designed for 13 million. North Bali—beautiful, underserved, economically stagnant—would get its turn.</p>
<p>The benefits seemed obvious: infrastructure for the north, congestion relief for the south, balanced development across the island. President Jokowi himself called it a &quot;game-changer&quot; for regional equity.</p>
<p>That was a decade ago.</p>
<p>Today, there&#39;s no airport. No land acquisition. No permits. No runway. Not even a confirmed site. What there is: mounting frustration, political finger-pointing, and the growing suspicion that North Bali&#39;s airport was never meant to be more than a campaign promise.</p>

<em>Vision of modern airport infrastructure - the kind of world-class facility North Bali was promised</em></p>
<h2>The Numbers Game</h2>
<p>On paper, the case for North Bali Airport is irresistible.</p>
<p>Ngurah Rai handles <strong>97% of Bali&#39;s tourist arrivals</strong>, channeling millions through Denpasar and surrounding areas while North Bali languishes with single-digit tourism shares. A second airport could:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Redistribute 30-40% of tourist traffic</strong> northward</li>
<li><strong>Create 15,000 direct jobs</strong> in Buleleng</li>
<li><strong>Attract ₹12 trillion in private investment</strong> over 10 years</li>
<li><strong>Reduce travel time</strong> from airport to Lovina by 2.5 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Ministry projections estimated the airport could serve <strong>7-10 million passengers annually by 2035</strong>, turning Buleleng from Bali&#39;s forgotten regency into a competitive tourism hub.</p>
<p>But numbers only matter if you build the thing.</p>

<em>World-class airport infrastructure - the type of international standard facility North Bali deserves</em></p>
<h2>The Site Nobody Can Agree On</h2>
<p>Between 2015 and 2025, the North Bali Airport project has considered <strong>four different locations</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Kubutambahan</strong> (2015-2017): Rejected due to hilly terrain and inadequate land availability.</li>
<li><strong>Gerokgak</strong> (2017-2020): Abandoned after environmental impact assessments flagged concerns about coastal erosion and mangrove destruction.</li>
<li><strong>Buleleng Coast</strong> (2020-2023): Shelved when landowners demanded compensation rates 400% above government valuations.</li>
<li><strong>TBD</strong> (2023-present): Current status—&quot;under review.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>&quot;Every time we get close, something changes,&quot; said I Nyoman Suardana, head of the Buleleng Chamber of Commerce. &quot;Different ministry, different study, different site. At some point, you stop believing it&#39;s coming.&quot;</p>
<p>The problem isn&#39;t just logistics. It&#39;s <strong>political will</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Funding Problem Jakarta Won&#39;t Solve</h2>
<p>Building an international airport from scratch costs money—<strong>₹18-25 trillion</strong>, depending on capacity and infrastructure. The Indonesian government has made clear it won&#39;t shoulder that burden alone. The plan relies on <strong>Public-Private Partnerships (PPP)</strong>, where private investors fund construction in exchange for operational concessions.</p>
<p>But PPP deals require certainty: confirmed sites, approved environmental clearances, guaranteed returns. North Bali&#39;s airport has none of that.</p>
<p>&quot;No serious investor will commit billions to a project that doesn&#39;t have land locked down,&quot; said Adi Prabowo, infrastructure analyst at Jakarta-based PT Indosurvey. &quot;And no government agency wants to start land acquisition without funding secured. It&#39;s a chicken-and-egg problem, and neither side blinks first.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Transportation&#39;s 2025 budget allocates <strong>₹0</strong> for North Bali Airport construction. The line item reads &quot;feasibility study continuation&quot;—the same language it&#39;s used since 2019.</p>
<hr>
<h2>South Bali Doesn&#39;t Want Competition</h2>
<p>Officially, nobody in Bali&#39;s southern business community opposes the airport. Off the record? It&#39;s a different story.</p>
<p>Denpasar, Kuta, Seminy ak, Canggu—Bali&#39;s tourism economy runs on southern infrastructure. Hotels, restaurants, tour operators, transport companies—they&#39;ve all built empires around proximity to Ngurah Rai. A functional North Bali airport threatens that monopoly.</p>
<p>&quot;If tourists can fly directly to Lovina and skip the south entirely, what happens to our market share?&quot; asked a Denpasar hotel association executive who requested anonymity. &quot;We&#39;re not officially lobbying against it. But we&#39;re not exactly pushing for it either.&quot;</p>
<p>The political calculus is clear: South Bali votes. South Bali spends. And politicians, regardless of party, need both.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Environmental Wildcard</h2>
<p>Even if the funding and site issues were resolved tomorrow, North Bali&#39;s airport would still face a gaunlet of environmental approvals—and activists ready to fight.</p>
<p>Proposed sites in Gerokgak and Buleleng Coast both threatened <strong>mangrove forests and coastal ecosystems</strong> critical for storm surge protection (a particularly sensitive issue post-September floods). Local NGOs argue that building a massive concrete structure on Bali&#39;s northern coastline would accelerate erosion and destroy marine habitats.</p>
<p>&quot;We already learned the hard way what happens when you prioritize development over environment,&quot; said Putu Suartini, director of the Bali Environmental Forum. &quot;Another megaproject that ignores ecology? We&#39;ll fight it in court, in the media, and on the ground.&quot;</p>
<p>Indonesia&#39;s environmental review process has grown stricter in recent years, particularly for large-scale infrastructure. Activists successfully delayed Jakarta&#39;s coastal reclamation project for eight years. They could do the same to North Bali.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What the Government Isn&#39;t Saying</h2>
<p>In October 2025, Minister of Transportation Budi Karya Sumadi gave his most candid assessment yet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The North Bali Airport remains a priority. But we must balance infrastructure needs with fiscal responsibility and environmental sustainability.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: <em>It&#39;s not happening anytime soon</em>.</p>
<p>The government has quietly shifted focus to <strong>expanding Ngurah Rai&#39;s capacity</strong> instead—a ₹4.2 trillion renovation to handle 35 million passengers annually by 2030. It&#39;s cheaper, faster, and doesn&#39;t require starting from scratch in a politically complex region.</p>
<p>For North Bali, that&#39;s a death sentence disguised as pragmatism.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Northern Perspective</h2>
<p>&quot;They promised us jobs, investment, growth,&quot; said Made Yoga, a tour guide in Lovina. &quot;Ten years later, we&#39;re still waiting while southern Bali gets richer. At what point do we stop being patient?&quot;</p>
<p>The economic disparity between North and South Bali is stark:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average income in Denpasar: ₹78 million/year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Average income in Buleleng: ₹31 million/year</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tourism spending in South Bali: 94%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Tourism spending in North Bali: 3%</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An airport could close that gap. Or it could accelerate the same overdevelopment and environmental destruction that&#39;s plagued the south—just with a northern postcode.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Question Nobody&#39;s Asking</h2>
<p>Should North Bali even want this airport?</p>
<p>The promised benefits—jobs, tourism, investment—are real. But so are the risks: uncontrolled development, environmental degradation, loss of cultural identity. South Bali is a cautionary tale, not a blueprint.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe the better question is: what kind of development does North Bali actually need?&quot; said Dr. I Ketut Sudewa, an urban planner at Udayana University. &quot;Is it a mega-airport that turns Lovina into Canggu 2.0? Or is it sustainable infrastructure that preserves what makes North Bali special?&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s the conversation Indonesia should be having. Instead, it&#39;s having the same one it&#39;s had for ten years: promises, delays, and consultants billing by the hour.</p>
<hr>
<h2>What Happens Next?</h2>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation says a final site decision will be made by Q2 2026. Industry observers are skeptical. North Bali residents are exhausted. And southern business interests are quietly hoping the whole thing fades away.</p>
<p>If the airport ever breaks ground, it won&#39;t resemble the grand vision promised in 2015. It&#39;ll be smaller, more expensive, and arrive after the moment when it could have made a real difference.</p>
<p>Or it won&#39;t be built at all. And North Bali will keep waiting.</p>
<hr>
<h2>For Investors: What This Means</h2>
<p>If you&#39;re considering business opportunities in North Bali based on the airport promise, proceed with extreme caution. Land speculation tied to the airport has already burned investors who bought &quot;prime locations&quot; near proposed sites that never materialized.</p>
<p><strong>Smart investment in Bali—North or South—requires navigating a complex regulatory environment, understanding actual government priorities (not press releases), and building businesses on existing infrastructure, not hypothetical airports.</strong></p>
