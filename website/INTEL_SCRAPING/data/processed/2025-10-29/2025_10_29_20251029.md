* Deposits in foreign currencies have grown by 5.4% YoY to reach IDR 358.7 trillion as of September 2025.
* Indonesia's Amman Mineral is set to receive a permit to export copper concentrate, which was banned in mid-2023.
* Wall Street has reached new records, with Nvidia and Microsoft leading the charge.
* Apple's market capitalization has surpassed $4 trillion for the first time.
* The US has imposed 0% tariffs on Malaysia and Vietnam, potentially affecting Indonesia's exports.

**Impact Analysis**

The growth of deposits in foreign currencies is a positive sign for the Indonesian economy, indicating that investors are confident in the country's economic prospects. However, this also means that the country may face challenges in managing its foreign exchange reserves.

The permit to export copper concentrate will likely benefit Amman Mineral and other mining companies, but it may also lead to increased competition from other countries that have not imposed similar bans.

The performance of Wall Street and Apple's market capitalization are positive indicators for investors, but they also highlight the ongoing volatility in global markets.

**Action Items**

* Businesses with foreign currency exposure should monitor exchange rates and adjust their financial planning accordingly.
* Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios to minimize risk.
* Export-oriented companies should be prepared to adapt to changes in trade policies and tariffs.
* The government should continue to implement policies to boost domestic metal processing and reduce reliance on raw material exports.

**Details**

The growth of deposits in foreign currencies is a significant development for the Indonesian economy. According to BI, this growth is driven by increased investment in foreign currencies, particularly in US dollars. This trend is likely due to investors' confidence in the country's economic prospects and the stability of the rupiah.

The permit to export copper concentrate is a major development for Amman Mineral and other mining companies. The ban on exports was imposed in mid-2023 to boost domestic metal processing, but it has now been lifted. This will likely lead to increased competition from other countries that have not imposed similar bans.

The performance of Wall Street and Apple's market capitalization are positive indicators for investors. However, they also highlight the ongoing volatility in global markets. Investors should be cautious when making investment decisions and consider diversifying their portfolios to minimize risk.

In terms of practical implications for businesses and expats in Indonesia, it is essential to monitor exchange rates and adjust financial planning accordingly. Export-oriented companies should be prepared to adapt to changes in trade policies and tariffs. The government's efforts to boost domestic metal processing and reduce reliance on raw material exports are also worth noting.

Overall, the Indonesian economy continues to show signs of growth, but there are challenges that need to be addressed. Businesses and investors should remain vigilant and adjust their strategies accordingly.

**Executive Summary**

Indonesia continues to attract foreign investors, with numerous articles highlighting the country's growing appeal as a destination for international business and investment. The news also touches on various developments related to healthcare, education, and infrastructure, which are likely to impact both locals and expatriates living in Indonesia.

### Key Points

### Impact Analysis

The influx of foreign investors into Indonesia is likely to have a positive impact on the local economy, potentially leading to job creation and infrastructure development. However, it also raises concerns about market saturation and competition for existing businesses.

On the other hand, the planned construction of an international hospital at Sumber will undoubtedly improve healthcare services in Jakarta, making it more attractive to expats and locals who seek quality medical care. Nevertheless, this development may lead to increased costs for healthcare services and potentially exacerbate existing infrastructure challenges.

The Russian investment fraud case serves as a reminder that Indonesia's business environment can be vulnerable to scams and financial irregularities. As such, expats and businesses operating in Indonesia must exercise caution when engaging with local partners or investing in Indonesian ventures.

### Action Items

For businesses:

* Conduct thorough due diligence on potential investments or partnerships.
* Monitor market trends and competition to remain competitive.
* Consider collaborating with reputable local partners to tap into Indonesia's growing market.

For expats:

* Stay informed about local business practices and regulations.

* Take advantage of Indonesia's developing infrastructure by considering relocation to Jakarta or other growth areas.

### Details

The article "Foreign Investors Overflowing in Indonesia" suggests that despite global economic uncertainty, foreign investors remain drawn to Indonesia's growth prospects. This is largely due to the country's favorable business climate, skilled workforce, and strategic location within Southeast Asia. As a result, businesses operating in Indonesia are likely to face increased competition from new entrants.

The planned construction of an international hospital at Sumber marks another significant development in Jakarta's healthcare sector. The hospital will cater to both local and expatriate populations, providing enhanced medical services and potentially boosting the local economy through job creation and infrastructure investments.

However, the recent case of a Russian man accused of Rp31 billion investment fraud in Bali serves as a cautionary tale for businesses operating in Indonesia. It highlights the need for vigilance when engaging with local partners or investing in Indonesian ventures, particularly if unfamiliar with the local business environment.

In conclusion, the news from Indonesia highlights both opportunities and challenges for businesses and expats alike.
