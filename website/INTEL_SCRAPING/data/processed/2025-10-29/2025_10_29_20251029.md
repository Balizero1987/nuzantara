* Rendah (Low): Requires minimal permits and obligations.
* Menengah Rendah (Medium-Low): Requires moderate permits and obligations.
* Menengah Tinggi (Medium-High): Requires significant permits and obligations.
* Tinggi (High): Requires extensive permits and obligations.

The system provides a user-friendly interface for businesses to register, update their information, and obtain necessary permits. The government has also introduced various support mechanisms, including video tutorials and FAQs, to assist businesses in navigating the new system.
