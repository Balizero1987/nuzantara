**Purpose**: Prevent ‚Ç¨7 cost spikes and worker zombie states
**Applies to**: DevAI (Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B) endpoint

## üéØ CRITICAL: Optimal Settings (DO NOT CHANGE!)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ DevAI Endpoint (Qwen 2.5 Coder 7B) - INTERNAL ONLY
```yaml
Endpoint ID: 5g2h6nbyls47i7
Name: DevAI_Qwen
Model: zeroai87/devai-qwen-2.5-coder-7b
GPU: 2√ó RTX 80GB Pro ($2.18/hr when running)
Console: https://console.runpod.io/serverless/user/endpoint/5g2h6nbyls47i7

# WORKER SETTINGS (ULTRA-OPTIMIZED FOR INTERNAL USE)
Workers:
  Min: 0                    # Scale to zero when idle
  Max: 1                    # ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER increase (internal use only)

# TIMEOUT SETTINGS (MINIMUM COST)
Idle Timeout: 5 seconds     # ‚ö†Ô∏è ULTRA-LOW for max savings (was 10s)
Execution Timeout: 60s      # Kill jobs that take too long

# SCALING
Active Workers: 0-1         # Single worker maximum
Throttled Workers: 0-1      # Minimal standby (was 0-2)

# COST CONTROL (INTERNAL USAGE)
Estimated Cost: ‚Ç¨1-3/month  # Ultra-low (only you use it)
Max Cost (worst case): ‚Ç¨50/month if running 24/7
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ZANTARA Endpoint (Llama 3.1 8B) - INTERNAL ONLY
```yaml
Endpoint ID: itz2q5gmid4cyt
Name: ZANTARA_Llama
Model: zeroai87/zantara-llama-3.1-8b-merged
GPU: 2√ó RTX 80GB Pro ($2.18/hr when running)
Console: https://console.runpod.io/serverless/user/endpoint/itz2q5gmid4cyt

# WORKER SETTINGS (ULTRA-OPTIMIZED FOR INTERNAL USE)
Workers:
  Min: 0                    # Scale to zero when idle
  Max: 1                    # ‚ö†Ô∏è REDUCED from 2 (internal only)

# TIMEOUT SETTINGS (MINIMUM COST)
Idle Timeout: 5 seconds     # ‚ö†Ô∏è ULTRA-LOW for max savings (was 15s)
Execution Timeout: 60s      # Kill jobs that take too long

# SCALING
Active Workers: 0-1         # Single worker (not production traffic)
Throttled Workers: 0-1      # Minimal standby (was 0-3)

# COST CONTROL (INTERNAL USAGE)
Estimated Cost: ‚Ç¨2-8/month  # Ultra-low (only you use it)
Max Cost (worst case): ‚Ç¨65/month if running 24/7
```

### Key Settings (INTERNAL OPTIMIZATION)
| Setting | DevAI | ZANTARA | Rationale |
|---------|-------|---------|-----------|
| Max Workers | 1 | 1 | Single user (you) - no concurrency needed |
| Idle Timeout | 5s | 5s | ULTRA-LOW = 95% cost savings vs 120s |
| Throttled Workers | 1 | 1 | Minimal standby pool |
| Expected Cost | ‚Ç¨1-3/mo | ‚Ç¨2-8/mo | **Total: ‚Ç¨3-11/month for BOTH!** ‚úÖ |
| Usage Pattern | Sporadic dev | Sporadic testing | Internal development only |

## üö® CRITICAL WARNINGS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT Increase Idle Timeout!

**Why**:
- Caused ‚Ç¨7 spike on 2025-10-14
- High timeout (120s) ‚Üí vLLM crash ‚Üí worker zombie ‚Üí billing loop
- **5s timeout = 95% cost reduction vs 120s** ‚úÖ

**Current Setting**: 5 seconds (ULTRA-LOW for internal use)

**Trade-off**:
- Cold start: 6-10 seconds (acceptable for internal development)
- Warm: 1-3 seconds (if requests <5s apart)
- **Since you're the ONLY user**: Cold starts are RARE and acceptable!

**Rule**: DO NOT change from 5s! This is optimal for single-user internal usage.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT Increase Max Workers!

**Why**:
- 2 workers = 2√ó cost if both go zombie ($4.36/hr)
- DevAI is dev tool (not high-traffic app)
- 1 worker is sufficient

**Exception**: Only if concurrent users > 5 (won't happen for dev)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT Change GPU Type!

**Current**: 2√ó RTX 80GB Pro
**Why this GPU**:
- Qwen 7B needs ~14GB VRAM
- 80GB provides comfortable margin
- Cheaper than A100 ($2.18/hr vs $3.40/hr)

**Don't downgrade**: Smaller GPUs will OOM
**Don't upgrade**: Wastes money for no benefit

---

## ‚úÖ Safe Changes (If Needed)

### You CAN Change These (Safely)
```yaml
Execution Timeout: 60-120s     # Max job duration
GPUs per Worker: 1             # Don't need 2 for Qwen 7B
Container Image: (if updating model)
Environment Variables: (add/remove as needed)
```

### Before ANY Change:
1. Ask AI assistant first
2. Check if change affects costs
3. Test on separate endpoint if possible
4. Monitor for 1 hour after change

---

## üìä Expected Performance

### Cold Start (first request after idle)
- **Duration**: 6-10 seconds
- **What happens**: Worker scales from throttled ‚Üí running, loads model
- **Cost**: ~$0.03 per cold start
- **Acceptable**: For development AI tool

### Warm (worker already running)
- **Duration**: 1-3 seconds
- **What happens**: Worker processes request immediately
- **Cost**: Minimal (already paying for idle time)
- **Optimal**: For interactive development

### Idle Period (after last job)
- **Duration**: 10 seconds (then scales to throttled)
- **Cost**: $0.006 per idle cycle
- **Why important**: Keeps cost low between requests

---

## üîß How to Verify Current Config

### Via API
```bash
curl -s "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/5g2h6nbyls47i7" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RUNPOD_API_KEY" | jq '.gpuType, .workersMax, .idleTimeout'
```

### Via Console
1. https://console.runpod.io/serverless/user/endpoint/5g2h6nbyls47i7
2. **Settings** tab
3. Verify:
   - Max Workers = 1 ‚úÖ
   - Idle Timeout = 10s ‚úÖ
   - Active Workers ‚â§ 1 ‚úÖ

---

## üí∞ Cost Monitoring

### Check Current Billing
1. RunPod Console ‚Üí **Billing** tab
2. Look for daily charges
3. Expected: ‚Ç¨0.10-0.50/day for typical dev usage

### Red Flags
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Daily charge > ‚Ç¨2/day ‚Üí Something wrong (investigate)
üö® Daily charge > ‚Ç¨5/day ‚Üí CRITICAL (terminate workers immediately)
```

### Health Check (Every Morning)
```bash
curl -s "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/5g2h6nbyls47i7/health" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $RUNPOD_API_KEY" | jq '.workers'
```

**Good**:
```json
{
  "idle": 0-1,
  "ready": 0-1,
  "running": 0,
  "unhealthy": 0
}
```

**Bad**:
```json
{
  "unhealthy": 1+,    ‚Üê TERMINATE WORKERS!
  "running": 2+       ‚Üê Why 2? Should max 1!
}
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Emergency Actions

### If Workers Stuck (Unhealthy)
```bash
# 1. Check health
curl -s https://api.runpod.ai/v2/5g2h6nbyls47i7/health

# 2. If unhealthy > 0:
# Go to Console ‚Üí Workers tab ‚Üí Terminate All Workers

# 3. Wait 3 minutes for auto-restart

# 4. Verify health again
```

### If Unexpected Cost Spike
```bash
# 1. Terminate all workers IMMEDIATELY
Console ‚Üí Workers ‚Üí Terminate All

# 2. Check billing page
Console ‚Üí Billing ‚Üí See what's charging

# 3. Report to AI assistant with:
- Amount charged
- Time period
- Recent config changes
```

## üéì Why These Settings?

### Idle Timeout = 10s (Not 120s)
**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ 92% lower idle cost
- ‚úÖ Prevents vLLM crashes from long idle periods
- ‚úÖ Reduces zombie risk
- ‚úÖ Still acceptable latency for dev tools

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More cold starts (6-10s vs 1-3s)
- But: Cold starts are RARE (only first request after 10s idle)

**Math**:
```
Scenario: 50 requests/day, spaced 5 min apart

With 120s timeout:
- All 50 warm (1-3s) ‚úÖ
- But: 120s idle after each = 100 minutes billing
- Cost: 100 min √ó $2.18/hr = $3.63/day

With 10s timeout:
- First cold (6-10s), next 49 warm if <10s apart
- 10s idle after each = 8.3 minutes billing
- Cost: 8.3 min √ó $2.18/hr = $0.30/day ‚úÖ

Savings: $3.33/day √ó 30 days = $100/month saved!
```

---

### Max Workers = 1 (Not 2)
**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ 50% lower max cost ceiling
- ‚úÖ Single worker sufficient for dev usage
- ‚úÖ If zombie, only 1√ó cost (not 2√ó)

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Queue if >1 concurrent request
- But: DevAI is internal dev tool (rarely concurrent)

**When to increase**: Only if >5 concurrent devs using DevAI simultaneously (unlikely)

---

### GPU = 2√ó RTX 80GB Pro (Not Smaller/Larger)
**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Qwen 7B fits comfortably (~14GB / 80GB)
- ‚úÖ Cheaper than A100 ($2.18 vs $3.40/hr)
- ‚úÖ Reliable (won't OOM)

**Cons**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Overkill for 7B model (but safer)

**Alternatives considered**:
- RTX 4090 (24GB): $0.78/hr - TOO SMALL (OOM risk)
- A6000 (48GB): $1.59/hr - Could work but tight
- A100 (80GB): $3.40/hr - Overkill and expensive
