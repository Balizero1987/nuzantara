- Use abbreviated version in Custom Instructions

### "She doesn't access books"
- Verify files show "Processed" ‚úì
- Explicitly reference: "Based on Marcus Aurelius..."
- Check file formats (PDF/EPUB work best)

### "Wrong personality"
- Re-check System Prompt is saved
- Emphasize key sections (levels, voice, tone)

### "Too generic"
- Upload more specialized books
- Refine prompts to be more specific
- Ask her to cite sources
