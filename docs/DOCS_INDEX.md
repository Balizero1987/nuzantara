## 🚀 Workflow by Situation

### 1️⃣ **First Railway Setup**
```bash
# Step 1: Read quick guide
cat docs/railway/RAILWAY_STEP_BY_STEP.txt

# Step 2: Configure variables (copy/paste from file)
open docs/railway/RAILWAY_VARS_COPY_PASTE.txt
# Then go to Railway Dashboard and add them

# Step 3: Verify deployment
./scripts/check_railway_env.sh
```

### 2️⃣ **Deployment Fails / 502 Error**
```bash
# ⚠️ STOP! Before doing ANY fix:
open docs/debugging/DEBUGGING_DIARY_LESSONS_LEARNED.md

# Read sections:
# - "Root Cause Analysis"
# - "Debugging Flowchart"
# - "Best Practices"

# TIME SAVED: 92% (165 minutes)
```

### 3️⃣ **Add Environment Variables**
```bash
# Variable reference:
cat docs/railway/RAILWAY_VARS_COPY_PASTE.txt

# Detailed guide:
open docs/railway/RAILWAY_ENV_SETUP.md
```

### 4️⃣ **Understand System Architecture**
```bash
# Complete architecture:
open docs/railway/RAILWAY_SERVICES_CONFIG.md

# Current deployment status:
open docs/railway/DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESS.md
```

## ⚙️ Available Scripts

### `scripts/check_railway_env.sh` ⚡
**Usage**: Quick health check for Railway backend

```bash
./scripts/check_railway_env.sh
```

**Output**:
- ✅ HEALTHY → All good
- ⚠️ DEGRADED → Some services missing
- ❌ ERROR → Deployment failed

---

## 🎓 Best Practices (Quick Reference)

### ✅ ALWAYS DO:
1. **Read debugging diary first** before debugging deployment
2. **One fix at a time** + deploy + verify
3. **Ask for logs immediately** if deployment fails
4. **Use verification script** after each deploy

### ❌ NEVER DO:
1. **Don't debug without logs** (80% time wasted here!)
2. **Don't apply multiple fixes** together
3. **Don't assume** without verifying with data
4. **Don't insist on automation** if it fails 3 times

### 📊 Metrics
- Debugging WITH best practices: **15 minutes**
- Debugging WITHOUT best practices: **180 minutes**
- **Time saved: 92%**
