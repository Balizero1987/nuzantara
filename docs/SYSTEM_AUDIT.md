# Nuzantara System Audit & Verification
**Date:** 2025-12-04
**Status:** In Progress
**Objective:** Ensure impeccable production readiness for Backend (RAG) and Frontend (Webapp).

## 1. Architecture Overview
*   **Backend:** FastAPI + Qdrant (Vector DB) + OpenAI/Gemini (LLM)
*   **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TailwindCSS
*   **Deployment:** Fly.io (Dockerized)

## 2. Critical Checkpoints

### 2.1 Backend (`apps/backend-rag`)
- [ ] **Entry Point:** Verify `main_cloud.py` for proper middleware and startup logic.
- [ ] **Configuration:** Check `core/config.py` for secure env var handling.
- [ ] **Services:** Audit `services/` for error handling and logic gaps.
    - [ ] `intelligent_router.py`
    - [ ] `rag_service.py`
    - [ ] `chat_service.py`
- [ ] **Dependencies:** Verify `requirements-prod.txt` is minimal and secure.

### 2.2 Frontend (`apps/webapp-next`)
- [ ] **API Integration:** Audit `src/lib/api/` for robust error handling and types.
- [ ] **State Management:** Verify `src/lib/store/` (Zustand) for consistency.
- [ ] **UI/UX:** Check `src/components/` for "premium" feel and responsiveness.
- [ ] **Auth:** Verify `src/app/api/auth/` flow.

### 2.3 Deployment & Infrastructure
- [ ] **Dockerfiles:** Optimization check (multi-stage, size).
- [ ] **Fly.toml:** Resource allocation and health checks.
- [ ] **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow efficiency.

## 3. Findings & Recommendations
*(Populated during audit)*

### 3.1 Critical Issues (Must Fix)
*   **Code Duplication:** `IntelligentRouter.route_chat` and `stream_chat` share ~50 lines of complex context-building logic. This violates DRY and risks inconsistency.
*   **Security:** `/debug/config` endpoint in `main_cloud.py` exposes configuration details. Should be disabled or protected in production.
*   **Frontend Lint:** 51 Lint errors (mostly `no-require-imports` in tests). This blocks "impeccable" status.

### 3.2 Optimization Opportunities (Should Fix)
*   **RAG Quality:** `_rewrite_query_for_search` is a stub. Implementing query rewriting (using LLM) would improve retrieval for follow-up questions.
*   **Synthetic Data:** `synthetic_context` is currently hardcoded to empty string.
*   **Prompt Efficiency:** `GeminiJakselService` injects few-shot examples in both system instruction and history.

### 3.3 Code Quality & Consistency
*   **Backend:** `config.py` is well-structured with Pydantic validators.
*   **Frontend:** Build passes successfully. `client.ts` correctly handles JWT and API Keys.
*   **Architecture:** Modular service design is solid, but the Router class is becoming a "God Object".
