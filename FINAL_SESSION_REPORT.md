### Integration Points

```
User Query
    ↓
[1] CLARIFICATION CHECK (pre-processing)
    → If ambiguous: return clarification request (early exit)
    → If clear: continue to next phase
    ↓
[2] AI PROCESSING (intelligent routing)
    → Route to Haiku/Sonnet/DevAI
    → Execute RAG search if needed
    ↓
[3] CITATION PROCESSING (post-processing)
    → Extract sources from RAG
    → Format sources section
    → Append to response
    ↓
[4] FOLLOW-UP GENERATION (metadata enrichment)
