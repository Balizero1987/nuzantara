## 1) OSS RBA — Core Flow (All Sectors)

Risk levels and resulting paths (per OSS RBA):
- Low (R): NIB only
- Medium‑Low (MR): NIB + Sertifikat Standar (self‑declaration)
- Medium‑High (MT): NIB + Sertifikat Standar (government verification)
- High (T): NIB + Business/Operating License (Izin Operasional/Izin Usaha)

Core steps (typical sequence):
1. Legal entity setup (PT PMA) → AHU approval (Akta, SK Kemenkumham)
2. OSS account + NIB issuance (instant) → NPWP (auto)
3. Sertifikat Standar (self/verified) according to risk level
4. Environmental approvals (SPPL/UKL‑UPL/AMDAL) integrated to OSS
5. Sectoral permits (BPOM/BPJPH/Kominfo/OJK/BI/LPJK/etc.)
6. Facility permits (PBG, SLF), K3 & fire safety
7. Start of operations + reporting/compliance

Key documents (baseline):
- Company docs (Akta, SK, NPWP, KBL, domisili)
- BO/management IDs, share composition, investment plan (≥ IDR 10B per KBLI per location)
- Site documents (land rights/lease, site plan, layout)
- Policies: K3, environmental management, data/privacy as applicable

SLAs (indicative): NIB (same day); MR self‑standard (1–3d); MT (2–4w verification); T (2–8w license). Environmental may extend timeline (see section 2).

## 2) Environmental Approvals (SPPL / UKL‑UPL / AMDAL)

When required:
- SPPL (low impact): declaration for small‑scale, low risk

AMDAL standard flow:
1. Scoping & TOR (KA‑ANDAL)
2. Baseline studies (air, water, soil, biodiversity, social)
3. Impact prediction & evaluation
4. Public consultation (mandatory)
5. RKL/RPL (management & monitoring plans)
6. AMDAL Commission review and approval

Deliverables: KA‑ANDAL, ANDAL, RKL, RPL; environmental approvals uploaded to OSS. SLA: 3–6 months typical (excluding data collection); longer for complex projects.
