## How To Use
- Start with “Risk→License Mapping” to understand OSS RBA outcomes.
- Jump to the Agent section you need and open the linked domain document.
- Use each domain’s “Complete Code Index”, “Per‑Code Addendum”, and “Quick Reference Matrix” for precise ownership, risk, licenses, certifications, timelines, and costs.

### Pricing Convention — Bali Zero
- In all simulations and examples across the KBLI domain documents, pricing is set to “Bali Zero” (IDR 0) by default.
- Regulatory fees and mandatory certification costs may still be referenced for awareness, but example totals adopt Bali Zero.
- Replace with real vendor quotes during implementation.

### Pricing & Quotes
- Service pricing and quotations are provided on request and are not listed in the KB.
- Reference: Desktop/BalizeroPricelist2025.txt (Bali Zero Services — Price List 2025).

## Risk → License Mapping (OSS RBA)
- Low (R): NIB only
- Medium‑Low (MR): NIB + Sertifikat Standar (self‑declaration)
- Medium‑High (MT): NIB + Sertifikat Standar (government‑verified)
- High (T): NIB + Business/Operating License; full verifications; sector approvals; often Environmental AMDAL

Cross‑cutting: Environmental approvals (SPPL/UKL‑UPL/AMDAL) depend on scale/impact; sectoral licenses (Kominfo/OJK/BI/LPJK/Disnaker/KAN/DJKI/SNI/TKDN) apply per activity.
