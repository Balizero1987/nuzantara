## 8. TAX RESIDENCY & WITHHOLDING

### 8.1 Tax Residency Rules

**183-Day Rule**:
- Present in Indonesia **183+ days in any 12-month period** → Tax resident
- Present <183 days → Non-resident (for tax purposes)

**Tax Resident Obligations**:
- File annual Indonesian tax return
- Report worldwide income (though foreign income may be exempt under tax treaties)
- Progressive tax rates: 5% - 35%

**Non-Resident Taxation**:
- Subject to **20% withholding tax** (WHT) on Indonesian-sourced income only
- Foreign income: NOT taxed by Indonesia
- No tax return filing required

### 8.2 Tax Residency Certificate (Certificate of Domicile - CoD)

**Purpose**: Reduce withholding tax via tax treaty benefits

**Form DGT** (Indonesia's Tax Residency Certificate):
- Issued by Indonesian tax authority (Direktorat Jenderal Pajak)
- Proves tax residency in home country (to claim treaty benefits)
- Must be certified by **home country's competent tax authority**

**Example** (US Citizen):
- US taxpayer requests **Form 6166** from IRS
- Form 6166 replaces Part III of Indonesia Form DGT-1/DGT-2
- Submit to Indonesian withholding agent → Reduced WHT rate (per US-Indonesia tax treaty)

### 8.3 Withholding Tax Rates (Non-Treaty)

**For Non-Residents Without CoD**:
- General Indonesian-sourced income: **20% WHT**
- Dividends: 20%
- Interest: 20%
- Royalties: 20%

**With Tax Treaty + CoD**:
- Reduced rates (e.g., US-Indonesia treaty: 10% dividends, 10% interest, 10% royalties)

### 8.4 Digital Nomad Tax Strategy (E33G Visa)

**Scenario 1: Stay <183 Days**
- **Status**: Non-tax resident
- **Foreign Income (remote work)**: ZERO Indonesian tax
- **Indonesian Income**: PROHIBITED on E33G visa anyway
- **Tax Filing**: None required

**Scenario 2: Stay 183+ Days**
- **Status**: Tax resident
- **Foreign Income**: Must file tax return; however, foreign employment income generally exempt under most tax treaties
- **Indonesian Income**: PROHIBITED on E33G visa
- **Tax Filing**: Required (annual SPT - Surat Pemberitahuan Tahunan)

**Recommendation**:
- Track days meticulously using calendar/app
- If approaching 183 days, consider exiting Indonesia temporarily to reset count

### 8.5 NPWP (Tax Number) for Visa Holders

**When NPWP Required**:
- Work KITAS (C312): MANDATORY
- Investor KITAS (E23A): MANDATORY (for company director)
- Retirement, Student, Digital Nomad: Generally NOT required (unless tax resident filing return)

**How to Obtain NPWP**:

## 9. EMBASSY PROCESSING & TELEX SYSTEM

### 9.1 Telex Visa Process Overview

**What is Telex?**
- Electronic visa approval system
- Indonesian Immigration sends approval directly to embassy/consulate (not to applicant)
- Applicant presents telex number at embassy to receive physical visa stamp

**Telex Flow**:
```
Step 1: Apply for VITAS via eVisa (https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id)
         ↓ (10-14 days processing)
Step 2: Immigration approves VITAS → Sends telex to designated embassy
         ↓ (Email notification to applicant with telex number)
Step 3: Applicant visits embassy with passport + telex number
         ↓ (Embassy verifies telex, stamps VITAS in passport)
Step 4: VITAS valid 90 days (single entry) → Enter Indonesia
         ↓
Step 5: Convert VITAS to KITAS in Indonesia (within 7 days of arrival)
```

### 9.2 Telex Delays & Processing Times (2025 Reality)

**Official Processing Times** (From Immigration Website):
- VITAS approval: 5-7 business days
- Telex transmission: Instant
- Embassy visa stamping: 1-3 business days

**Actual Processing Times** (Based on Practitioner Reports):
- **VITAS Approval**: 10-14 business days (sometimes up to 4 weeks)
- **Telex Delays**:
  - Peak season (June-August, December): 2-4 week delays common
  - Embassy backlog: Some embassies take 1-2 weeks to process after telex received
  - System glitches: Occasional 1-week delays in telex transmission
- **Embassy Stamping**: 3-10 business days (varies widely by embassy)

**Total Realistic Timeline**:
- **Best Case**: 3-4 weeks (application to visa in passport)
- **Average**: 4-6 weeks
- **Worst Case**: 8-12 weeks (peak season, complex cases, embassy delays)

### 9.3 Embassy-Specific Variations

**Faster Embassies** (Anecdotal Reports):
- Singapore: 2-3 weeks total
- Kuala Lumpur: 3-4 weeks
- Bangkok: 3-4 weeks

**Slower Embassies**:
- Jakarta (for applications while in Indonesia on tourist visa): 4-8 weeks
- Some European embassies: 6-10 weeks
- US embassies (varying): 4-8 weeks

**Note**: Processing times vary significantly based on embassy workload and staffing.

### 9.4 Common Telex Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: Telex Not Received by Embassy**
- **Cause**: System error, incorrect embassy designation
- **Solution**:
  - Wait 2 weeks after VITAS approval
  - Contact Indonesian Immigration via email: info@imigrasi.go.id
  - Request telex retransmission
  - Provide VITAS approval number, passport number, designated embassy

**Issue 2: VITAS Approved But No Email Notification**
- **Cause**: Incorrect email in application, spam filter
- **Solution**:
  - Log into eVisa portal, check application status
  - If status = "Approved", telex number shown in portal
  - Visit embassy with telex number (no need to wait for email)

**Issue 3: Embassy Cannot Find Telex**
- **Cause**: Telex sent to wrong embassy, not yet transmitted
- **Solution**:
  - Verify designated embassy in eVisa application matches embassy you're visiting
  - Contact Indonesian Immigration to confirm telex destination
  - Request embassy to check again after 1 week

**Issue 4: VITAS Expires Before Embassy Appointment Available**
- **Cause**: Long embassy wait times
- **Solution**:
  - Apply for VITAS extension via eVisa (before expiry)
  - OR reapply for new VITAS (additional fee)

### 9.5 Embassy Fees by Region (2025)

**Asia-Pacific**:
- Singapore: USD 50
- Malaysia (KL): USD 50
- Thailand (Bangkok): USD 50
- Australia: AUD 80-120 (USD 55-80)

**Europe**:

- Saudi Arabia: USD 80-120

**Note**: Fees vary by visa type (VITAS for work, retirement, student, etc.). Above are estimates for standard VITAS types.

### 9.6 Alternative: Visa on Arrival + Conversion (NOT Recommended)

**Grey Area Practice** (Not officially supported):
- Some applicants enter on VOA/tourist visa
- Apply for VITAS while in Indonesia (telex to Jakarta embassy)
- Attempt to convert tourist visa to KITAS

**Risks**:
- Immigration may reject (policy: VITAS must be obtained from abroad)
- Long processing time (8-12 weeks) while on tourist visa (max 60-day stay)
- May need to exit Indonesia mid-process, losing investment
- Risk of overstay if process exceeds tourist visa validity

**Recommendation**: **ALWAYS apply for VITAS from home country or current residence country.** Do NOT attempt VOA conversion unless advised by experienced immigration lawyer.
