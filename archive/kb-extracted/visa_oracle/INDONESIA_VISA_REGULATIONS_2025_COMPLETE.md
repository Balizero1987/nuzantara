## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls & Enforcement {#enforcement}

### **Top 10 Mistakes Foreigners Make**

#### **1. Working on Tourist Visa**
**Violation**: Working (even remote work) on VOA/C211A/visa-free
**Penalty**: Deportation + 5-year ban + criminal charges
**Enforcement**:
- 2023: 163 deportations for immigration violations (Jan-Jun)
- 2025: Increased raids on coworking spaces, cafes (targeting digital nomads)

**Example Case**:
- Australian digital nomad (2024) deported from Bali for working remotely on VOA
- Reason: Immigration officer saw laptop + Zoom call in cafe
- Result: Deported + 2-year ban

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- Get C312 work permit (if working for Indonesian company), OR
- Use Second Home Visa + work remotely for foreign company (grey area, technically allowed if NO Indonesian clients)

---

#### **2. Overstaying Visa**
**Violation**: Staying beyond visa expiry without extension
**Penalty**: IDR 1,000,000/day (USD 65/day) + deportation if >60 days
**Enforcement**:
- Automatic detection at airport departure (immigration system flags overstay)
- Cannot exit Indonesia until fine paid

**Example Case**:
- American tourist (2023) overstayed C211A by 45 days
- Fine at airport: IDR 45,000,000 (USD 3,000)
- Result: Paid fine, allowed to leave, 6-month ban

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- Set calendar reminder 30 days before expiry
- Apply for extension 14-30 days before expiry
- If emergency: Apply within 7 days (minimum) OR pay late fee

---

#### **3. Wrong Immigration Office (Domicile Mismatch)**
**Violation**: Applying for extension at immigration office outside your residence area
**Penalty**: Application rejected + wasted fee
**Enforcement**:
- SE IMI-417 (May 2025) introduced strict domicile verification
- Officer checks rental agreement address vs immigration office wilayah kerja

**Example**:
- Expat lives in Denpasar, applied at Singaraja office (North Bali)
- Result: Application rejected, lost IDR 3,000,000 fee, had to reapply at Ngurah Rai office

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- Find your wilayah kerja: https://www.imigrasi.go.id (directory)
- Match rental agreement address to correct office
- If unsure: Call immigration office to confirm before applying

---

#### **4. Sponsor Not Attending Photo/Interview**
**Violation**: KITAS extension without sponsor present (SE IMI-417 requirement)
**Penalty**: Application rejected
**Enforcement**:
- Sponsor MUST attend photo/interview (cannot be done via agent proxy)
- Sponsor = company representative (C312), Indonesian spouse (C314), or visa agency (E33F)

**Example**:
- British expat applied for C312 extension (work permit)
- Sponsor company sent junior staff member (not authorized)
- Result: Rejected, had to reschedule with company director present

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- Coordinate with sponsor BEFORE booking appointment
- Sponsor brings: company stamp, authorization letter, ID card
- Both applicant + sponsor attend together

---

#### **5. LKPM Not Filed (PT PMA Companies)**
**Violation**: PT PMA holder with C313 KITAS failed to file LKPM quarterly report
**Penalty**: KITAS extension rejected + risk of business license revocation
**Enforcement**:
- Immigration cross-checks OSS system for LKPM compliance
- 3 consecutive missed LKPM reports = automatic NIB revocation

**Example Case**:
- Dutch investor (2024) with PT PMA in Bali
- Didn't file LKPM for 2 quarters (no revenue yet, thought it's optional)
- KITAS extension rejected
- Result: Had to file backdate LKPM (with penalties), then reapply

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- File LKPM EVERY QUARTER (even if zero revenue)
- Due dates: Apr 30, Jul 31, Oct 31, Jan 31
- Use OSS online system: https://oss.go.id
- If late: File ASAP (late penalty: IDR 1M-5M)

---

#### **6. Nominee Real Estate (Related to Visa)**
**Violation**: Using nominee structure to "own" property, then applying for retirement/second home visa
**Penalty**: Visa rejected + property seizure + deportation
**Enforcement**:
- 2023 K3NI investigation: 185 certificates revoked
- Immigration now coordinates with BPN (land office) to verify property ownership
- Second Home Visa requires LEGAL Hak Pakai (not nominee)

**Example Case**:
- Australian retiree (2024) applied for E33F retirement visa
- Claimed to "own" villa in Canggu (nominee structure)
- Immigration checked BPN: Property under Indonesian name (not Hak Pakai)
- Result: Visa denied, property seized (Art. 26 UUPA), deported, money NOT returned

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- NEVER use nominee for property
- Get Hak Pakai (25-30 years, legally allowed for foreigners)
- For Second Home Visa: Property MUST be registered in your name
- Alternative: Rent (1-year lease) instead of buying

---

#### **7. Health Insurance Expiry**
**Violation**: KITAS holder's health insurance expired during visa validity
**Penalty**: KITAS extension rejected + potential visa cancellation
**Enforcement**:
- Immigration verifies health insurance validity during extension
- Policy must cover ‚â•1 year into future (from extension date)

**Example**:
- German expat with C312 work permit
- Health insurance expired 3 months before KITAS extension
- Immigration rejected extension until insurance renewed

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- Set reminder to renew health insurance 2 months before expiry
- Policy requirements: Min IDR 25,000,000 (USD 1,600) coverage
- Accepted providers: Indonesian insurance companies OR international (with Indonesian coverage)

---

#### **8. IMTA Expired (Work Permit)**
**Violation**: C312 KITAS holder's IMTA (work permit) expired before KITAS
**Penalty**: KITAS extension rejected + cannot work legally
**Enforcement**:
- IMTA validity MUST match or exceed KITAS validity
- Immigration checks IMTA status via Ministry of Manpower database

**Example**:
- Japanese engineer with C312 KITAS valid until Dec 2025
- IMTA expired Aug 2025 (company forgot to renew)
- Applied for KITAS extension Oct 2025 ‚Üí Rejected

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- IMTA renewal = sponsor company responsibility (NOT individual)
- Check IMTA expiry date: https://tka-online.kemnaker.go.id
- Renew IMTA 2-3 months before expiry
- KITAS cannot be extended until IMTA renewed

---

#### **9. C18 Trial Worker Visa Misuse (SE IMI-453)**
**Violation**: Using C18 visa for full employment (not trial period)
**Penalty**: Deportation + sponsor blacklisted
**Enforcement**:
- SE IMI-453 (Jun 2025): C18 max 90 days, NOT extendable
- Cannot reuse same sponsor for another C18

**Example**:
- Filipino worker hired by Bali restaurant on C18 (trial worker)
- After 90 days, company tried to extend ‚Üí Rejected (C18 non-extendable)
- Worker had to leave Indonesia, apply for C312 KITAS from Philippines

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- C18 = 90-day trial period ONLY (skill assessment, not formal employment)
- If hired after trial: Worker leaves Indonesia ‚Üí Apply for C312 KITAS from home country
- Cannot convert C18 to C312 while in Indonesia

---

#### **10. Visa Shopping / Border Runs (No Longer Allowed)**
**Violation**: Leaving Indonesia every 60 days on VOA/visa-free, immediately re-entering (repeat)
**Penalty**: Entry denial + blacklist
**Enforcement**:
- 2024 policy change: Immigration tracks total days in Indonesia per year
- Limit: 180 days/year on tourist visa (VOA/visa-free combined)
- Exceeding 180 days = suspicious (visa abuse)

**Example Case**:
- British "digital nomad" (2024) did 3√ó visa runs (VOA 60d + leave 1 day + VOA 60d + ...)
- After 4th entry attempt: Denied at airport (flagged for visa abuse)
- Immigration officer: "You've been here 240 days this year on tourist visa. Get proper visa or don't return."
- Result: Denied entry, 1-year ban

**‚úÖ Correct Approach**:
- If staying >180 days/year: Get proper long-term visa (C211A ‚Üí C312 OR Second Home)
- Visa runs acceptable only for genuine tourists (short stays)
- Digital nomads: Use Second Home Visa (can stay 5-10 years)

---

### **2025 Enforcement Trends**

#### **Increased Coordination Between Agencies**

**Immigration + Tax Office (DJP)**:
- Cross-check: Foreigners working in Indonesia must have NPWP (tax ID)
- If income in Indonesia + no NPWP = tax evasion investigation
- 2024-2025: 50+ cases prosecuted

**Immigration + BKPM (Investment Board)**:
- Verify C313 KITAS holders have ACTIVE PT PMA (not shell company)
- Quarterly LKPM reports mandatory
- 2023: 267 companies had licenses revoked (Operation Wira Waspada)

**Immigration + BPN (Land Office)**:
- Verify property ownership for Second Home Visa applicants
- Nominee structures flagged
- 2023-2024: 185 property certificates revoked, 163 deportations

**Immigration + Police (Cyberspace)**:
- Monitor social media for visa violations
- Instagram/TikTok posts showing "working in Bali" on tourist visa = investigation
- 2024: 12 influencers deported for working without permit

---

#### **Digital Nomad Crackdown (2024-2025)**

**Background**:
- Bali became digital nomad hub during COVID (2020-2022)

   - Officer asked: "What visa?" ‚Üí VOA
   - Fined IDR 50,000,000 (USD 3,300), deported

**Government Position (2025)**:
- Minister of Tourism: "Digital nomads welcome, but get proper visa"
