## 🚨 Common Pitfalls - Alert Visa Oracle Users

### 1. Working on Tourist/Business Visa
- **Issue**: Remote work on e-VOA or C1/B211A visa = ILLEGAL
- **Consequence**: Deportation + 2-year ban + employer fines
- **Solution**: Obtain Digital Nomad KITAS E33G (legal remote work status)
- **Alert**: "Working remotely on tourist visa is illegal. Apply for Digital Nomad KITAS E33G (USD 1,050, 4-6 weeks)."

### 2. VITAS Expired Before Arrival
- **Issue**: VITAS has 60-day validity, cannot be extended abroad
- **Consequence**: Must reapply (restart RPTKA → VITAS process = 10-12 weeks)
- **Solution**: Book flight IMMEDIATELY after VITAS issued
- **Alert**: "VITAS expires in [X] days. Book flight to Indonesia NOW or must reapply (10-12 weeks restart)."

### 3. KITAS Conversion Not Completed Within 60 Days
- **Issue**: VITAS must be converted to KITAS within 60 days of arrival
- **Consequence**: VITAS voids, overstay penalties (IDR 1M/day = USD 65/day)
- **Solution**: Convert KITAS immediately upon arrival (use Bali Zero agent)
- **Alert**: "Convert VITAS to KITAS within 60 days of arrival. Deadline = [Date]. Overstay fine USD 65/day if late."

### 4. Working on Family KITAS or Retirement KITAS
- **Issue**: Family KITAS and Retirement KITAS do NOT allow work
- **Consequence**: Deportation + ban + employer fines
- **Solution**: Obtain separate Work KITAS (employer sponsorship) or Digital Nomad KITAS (remote work)
- **Alert**: "Family/Retirement KITAS CANNOT work. Need Work KITAS (employer-sponsored, USD 1,500-3,000) or Digital Nomad KITAS (remote work, USD 1,050)."

### 5. Traveling Abroad Without MERP
- **Issue**: Leaving Indonesia without MERP (Multiple Exit and Re-entry Permit) voids KITAS
- **Consequence**: Must reapply for KITAS from scratch (10-12 weeks + costs)
- **Solution**: Obtain MERP when getting KITAS (USD 50, valid 1-2 years)
- **Alert**: "ALWAYS get MERP (USD 50) when obtaining KITAS. Without MERP, leaving Indonesia voids KITAS (must reapply = 10-12 weeks + USD 1,500-3,000)."

### 6. Second Home Visa Applied From Abroad
- **Issue**: Second Home Visa can ONLY be applied from WITHIN Indonesia
- **Consequence**: Application rejected
- **Solution**: Enter Indonesia on e-VOA or tourist visa FIRST, then apply for Second Home Visa
- **Alert**: "Second Home Visa MUST be applied from WITHIN Indonesia. Enter on e-VOA (30 days) → Apply for Second Home Visa → Complete USD 130K deposit within 90 days."

### 7. Golden Visa/Second Home Investment Not Completed Within 90 Days
- **Issue**: Investment must be completed within 90 days of permit issuance
- **Consequence**: Visa voids, forfeit application fee (USD 800-1,200)
- **Solution**: Prepare investment BEFORE applying (open Indonesian bank account, select property, etc.)
- **Alert**: "Complete investment within 90 days of permit issuance. Deadline = [Date]. Prepare now: Open Indonesian State Owned bank account (Bank Mandiri, BNI, BRI, BTN) or select property."

### 8. Investor KITAS Without Sufficient PT PMA Capital
- **Issue**: PT PMA requires minimum IDR 10B (USD 650K) paid-up capital for Investor KITAS
- **Consequence**: KITAS application rejected
- **Solution**: Increase capital to IDR 10B OR find partner OR use Golden Visa instead (USD 2.5M)
- **Alert**: "Investor KITAS requires PT PMA with IDR 10B (USD 650K) paid-up capital. You have IDR [X]B. Options: 1) Increase capital (add IDR [Y]B). 2) Find partner (50-50 split). 3) Golden Visa (USD 2.5M)."

### 9. Overstay > 60 Days (Deportation Risk)
- **Issue**: Overstay > 60 days = possible detention + deportation + 2-year ban
- **Consequence**: Cannot re-enter Indonesia for 2 years, criminal record
- **Solution**: Contact Bali Zero IMMEDIATELY if overstay < 60 days (emergency service USD 500 + fine)
- **Alert**: "OVERSTAY DAY [X]. Fine = USD [Y] (USD 65/day). If > 60 days = deportation + 2-year ban. Contact Bali Zero 24/7 emergency hotline +62 813 3805 1876 NOW."

### 10. Digital Nomad KITAS Holder Working for Indonesian Company
- **Issue**: Digital Nomad KITAS E33G allows ONLY remote work for overseas company (NOT Indonesian company)
- **Consequence**: Visa voids, deportation + ban
- **Solution**: If working for Indonesian company, obtain Work KITAS (employer-sponsored)
- **Alert**: "Digital Nomad KITAS = remote work for OVERSEAS company ONLY. Working for Indonesian company = ILLEGAL. Obtain Work KITAS (employer-sponsored, USD 1,500-3,000, 10-12 weeks)."
