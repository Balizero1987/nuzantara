## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Contract Law (KUHPerdata Book III - Articles 1233-1864)

### **1.1 Legal Framework**

**Primary Source**: Indonesian Civil Code (Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Perdata / KUHPerdata)

**Book III**: Obligations (Perikatan) - Governs all contractual relationships in Indonesia

---

### **1.2 Key Legal Principles**

#### **Article 1338 - Pacta Sunt Servanda**
> *"All contracts validly concluded shall have the force of law for those who make them"*

**Implications**:
- Contracts are binding as law between parties
- Courts will enforce valid contracts unless they violate public policy
- Parties cannot unilaterally withdraw from contracts
- Foundation of Indonesian contract law

---

#### **Article 1320 - Four Validity Requirements**

For a contract to be legally valid, it must meet **FOUR conditions**:

1. **Consent** (Kesepakatan) - Both parties must agree freely without coercion, fraud, or mistake
2. **Capacity** (Kecakapan) - Parties must be legally competent (18+ years old, not under guardianship)
3. **Specific Subject Matter** (Hal Tertentu) - The contract must have a defined object
4. **Lawful Cause** (Sebab yang Halal) - Purpose must be legal and not contrary to law, public order, or morality

**Violation Consequences**:
- Requirements 1-2 (subjective): Contract is **voidable** (dapat dibatalkan) - can be annulled by court
- Requirements 3-4 (objective): Contract is **void ab initio** (batal demi hukum) - automatically null from the beginning

---

### **1.3 Breach of Contract (Wanprestasi)**

#### **Definition**
**Wanprestasi** = Default/breach where a party fails to perform contractual obligations as agreed

**Legal Basis**: Article 1239 KUHPerdata - Every obligation to perform must be carried out in good faith

#### **Four Forms of Wanprestasi**

1. **Non-performance** (tidak melaksanakan prestasi) - Complete failure to perform
2. **Delayed performance** (terlambat melaksanakan prestasi) - Late delivery/execution
3. **Improper performance** (melaksanakan prestasi tidak sempurna) - Performance not according to terms
4. **Prohibited acts** (melakukan perbuatan yang dilarang) - Doing something the contract forbids

---

### **1.4 Remedies for Breach**

#### **Primary Remedies (Articles 1243-1246)**

**1. Damages/Compensation (Ganti Rugi)**
- **Types**:
  - Direct losses (damnum emergens)
  - Lost profits (lucrum cessans)
- **Principle**: *Restitutio in integrum* - Injured party restored to original position
- **Calculation**: Must be proven and quantified
- **Articles 1243-1246**: Govern damage calculation and limitations

**2. Specific Performance (Pelaksanaan Prestasi)**
- Court orders breaching party to fulfill obligations as agreed
- Available when monetary damages are insufficient
- Common in real estate, unique goods, or service contracts

**3. Contract Termination (Pembatalan/Pemutusan Kontrak)**
- Injured party may terminate and sue for damages
- Must demonstrate material breach
- Does not waive right to claim damages for breach

---

#### **Penalty Clauses (Articles 1304-1310)**

**Purpose**: Pre-agreed liquidated damages to avoid proving actual loss

**Legal Requirements**:
- Must be explicitly stated in contract
- Amount must be reasonable (not punitive)
- Payable upon breach without need to prove damages
- Alternative OR cumulative with actual damages (depending on contract wording)

**Court Authority**:
- **Article 1309**: Courts can reduce excessive penalty clauses
- Judges assess reasonableness based on:
  - Proportion to potential loss
  - Bargaining power of parties
  - Nature of breach

---

### **1.5 Practical Guidance for Clients**

#### **Contract Drafting Best Practices**

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Use bilingual contracts (English + Bahasa Indonesia) with Indonesian as governing language
- Specify jurisdiction (Indonesian courts unless international arbitration agreed)
- Include detailed penalty clauses for specific breaches
- Define "force majeure" events clearly
- Require written amendments only
- Include dispute resolution mechanism (mediation ‚Üí arbitration ‚Üí court)

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Use one-sided penalty clauses (courts will reduce)
- Rely on oral modifications (must be written)
- Ignore "lawful cause" requirement (contracts for illegal purposes are void)
- Assume foreign law applies (Indonesian law governs unless explicitly stated otherwise)

---

#### **Red Flags - Contracts Likely VOID**

‚ö†Ô∏è **These contracts are automatically null and void**:

1. **Nominee agreements** for land ownership by foreigners (violates UUPA Article 21)
2. **Contracts to bribe officials** (unlawful cause)
3. **Agreements to evade taxes** (violates tax law)
4. **Property sales without proper title verification** (invalid subject matter)
5. **Employment contracts below minimum wage** (violates labor law)

---

<a name="property-law"></a>
## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Property Law (UUPA 1960 & KUHPerdata Book II)

### **2.1 Legal Framework**

**Primary Law**: UUPA (Undang-Undang Pokok Agraria) Law No. 5/1960 - Basic Agrarian Law

**Effective**: September 24, 1960 (replaced Dutch colonial property law)

**Fundamental Principle**: Article 1 UUPA
> *"All land, water, and air space within Indonesian territory is controlled by the State"*

---

### **2.2 Land Rights Hierarchy**

#### **Primary Rights (Hak Primer)**

| Right | Indonesian Name | Who Can Own | Max Duration | Renewable? |
|-------|----------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **Freehold** | Hak Milik | Indonesian citizens ONLY | Permanent | N/A |
| **Right to Build** | Hak Guna Bangunan (HGB) | Indonesian citizens + PT PMA | 30 years (+20+30) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Right to Cultivate** | Hak Guna Usaha (HGU) | Indonesian citizens + PT PMA | 35 years (+25) | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Right to Use** | Hak Pakai | Indonesian citizens + foreigners* | 25-30 years (+20) | ‚úÖ Yes |

*Foreigners can hold Hak Pakai IF residing in Indonesia with valid KITAS/KITAP

#### **Secondary Rights**

- **Leasehold** (Hak Sewa) - 25 years (renewable)
- **Apartment Units** (HMASRS) - Foreigners CAN own (UU 20/2011)
- **Usufruct** (Hak Pakai atas Tanah Milik Orang Lain) - Private arrangements

---

### **2.3 Article 21 UUPA - The Foreigner Ban**

#### **Full Text (Paraphrased)**

> *"Only Indonesian citizens may have ownership rights (Hak Milik) over land. If ownership rights are acquired by a foreigner through inheritance without will, or through mixed marriage, the heir or surviving spouse must transfer the rights within one year. If not transferred within one year, the land shall revert to the State."*

**Key Points**:
- ‚ùå **Foreigners CANNOT hold Hak Milik** (freehold) under any circumstances
- ‚ùå **Nominee arrangements are illegal** (addressed in Article 26)
- ‚úÖ Foreigners can inherit land but **MUST sell within 1 year**
- ‚úÖ Foreigners married to Indonesians can own IF prenuptial/postnuptial agreement exists

---

### **2.4 Article 26 UUPA - The "Money Not Returned" Rule**

#### **Full Text (Critical for Clients)**

**Article 26 Paragraph (2)**:
> *"Any sale and purchase of land with ownership rights (Hak Milik) to a person or entity that is not eligible shall be null and void. The land shall revert to the State, and money paid shall NOT be returned."*

#### **Practical Implications**

**Scenario**: Foreign buyer pays USD 500,000 to Indonesian seller for land with Hak Milik

**What happens**:
1. üö´ Sale is **void ab initio** (never legally existed)
2. üèõÔ∏è Land **reverts to the State** (becomes Tanah Negara)
3. üí∏ USD 500,000 **NOT returned to foreigner** (Indonesian seller keeps it)
4. ‚öñÔ∏è No legal recourse for foreigner (Supreme Court precedent: 0% success rate)

**Why so harsh?**:
- Deterrent against illegal land acquisitions
- Protects Indonesian land sovereignty
- Prevents foreign land speculation

---

### **2.5 Legal Alternatives for Foreigners**

#### **Option 1: Hak Pakai (Right to Use) - Individual**

**Requirements**:
- Valid KITAS/KITAP (min. 1 year stay permit)
- Property max 2,000 m¬≤ (residential)
- Proper notarization + BPN registration

**Duration**: 25-30 years, renewable (+20 years)

**Pros**:
- 100% legal
- Can build/renovate
- Can be mortgaged (limited banks)
- Inheritable (heirs must sell within 1 year)

**Cons**:
- Not permanent (max 50 years total)
- Cannot sell easily (few buyers want Hak Pakai)
- Tied to immigration status

**Cost**: IDR 15M - 30M (notary + BPN fees)

---

#### **Option 2: PT PMA (Foreign Investment Company)**

**Structure**: Limited liability company with foreign ownership

**Land Rights Available**:
- ‚úÖ Hak Guna Bangunan (HGB) - 30+20+30 = 80 years
- ‚úÖ Hak Guna Usaha (HGU) - 35+25 = 60 years (agriculture)

**Requirements**:
- Minimum capital: IDR 10 billion per KBLI per location
- Paid-up capital: IDR 2.5 billion
- Must have business license (NIB)
- Cannot use for personal residence (must be commercial)

**Pros**:
- Longest legal tenure (80 years HGB)
- Company can own multiple properties
- Can generate rental income
- Tax deductible expenses

**Cons**:
- High capital requirement
- Annual compliance (LKPM, taxes, audit)
- Cannot be purely residential (must be commercial)
- Complex setup (2-3 months, IDR 50M+ costs)

**Use Cases**:
- Villa rentals (KBLI 55130)
- Restaurants/bars (KBLI 56101/56301)
- Real estate development (KBLI 68111)

---

#### **Option 3: Leasehold (Hak Sewa)**

**Structure**: Long-term lease agreement (typically 25-30 years)

**Pros**:
- No immigration status required
- Lower upfront cost
- Simple legal structure
- Renewable by negotiation

**Cons**:
- NOT a land right (only contractual)
- Landlord can refuse renewal
- Vulnerable to landlord bankruptcy/death
- Limited financing options

**Critical Clauses to Include**:
1. Renewal option (first right of refusal)
2. Sublease rights
3. Transfer rights (to heirs/buyers)
4. Landlord's obligation to extend Hak Milik certificate
5. Exit compensation clause
6. Dispute resolution (arbitration preferred)

**Cost**: Varies (1-3x annual rent upfront)

---

#### **Option 4: NEVER - Nominee Arrangements**

**Structure**: Indonesian "nominee" holds Hak Milik, foreigner provides funds

**Legal Reality**:
- üö´ **100% ILLEGAL** (violates UUPA Article 21 & 26)
- üö´ **Supreme Court: 0/140 cases won by foreigners** (MA 3020 K/Pdt/2014)
- üö´ **2023 Enforcement**: 185+ certificates revoked, 163 deportations
- üö´ **Money NOT returned** (Article 26 UUPA)

**Why people still do it**:
- Cheaper than PT PMA
- Permanent ownership "illusion"
- Unethical agents promote it

**Why it ALWAYS fails**:
- Nominee can sell property anytime (foreigner has no legal claim)
- Nominee's creditors can seize property
- Nominee's heirs inherit property (not foreigner's heirs)
- Government can revoke certificate (Operation Wira Waspada 2023)
- Foreign "investor" deported + banned from Indonesia

**Bali Zero Policy**: ‚ùå **NEVER recommend nominee arrangements**

**Original Limitation**: Only **prenuptial** agreements allowed (before/during marriage ceremony)

---

#### **Constitutional Court Amendment (2015)**

**Decision No. 69/PUU-XIII/2015** ruled Article 29 unconstitutional as written

---

#### **Costs & Timeline**

| Step | Cost (IDR) | Duration |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Notary consultation | 1M - 3M | 1-2 hours |
| Draft prenuptial deed | 5M - 10M | 3-5 days |

---

### **3.4 Postnuptial Agreements (Perjanjian Pasca Nikah)**

#### **Legal Basis**
- Constitutional Court Decision 69/2015
- Indonesian Civil Code (property division provisions)
- Effective from May 2017

#### **Key Differences from Prenuptial**

| Aspect | Prenuptial | Postnuptial |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Timing | Before/during marriage | After marriage (while married) |
| Legal Basis | UU 1/1974 Article 29 | Constitutional Court 69/2015 |
| Registration | Marriage certificate | Civil Registry Office / KUA |
| Certificate Amendment | Required (recorded on certificate) | NOT required (separate deed) |
| Retroactive Effect | From marriage date | From signing date forward |

---

#### **Use Cases for Postnuptial Agreements**

**Scenario 1: Forgot Prenup**
- Mixed couple married without prenup
- Indonesian spouse wants to buy Hak Milik land
- Postnup allows property separation ‚Üí land purchase approved

**Scenario 2: Significant Financial Change**
- One spouse receives large inheritance
- Wants to protect assets from potential divorce
- Postnup separates pre-existing + new assets

**Scenario 3: Business Formation**
- Indonesian spouse starting PT PMA
- Needs clean asset separation for investment licensing
- Postnup clarifies ownership structure

**Scenario 4: Divorce Prevention**
- Marital issues arise
- Postnup protects assets before potential split
- Can be used defensively

---

#### **Registration Process**

**Step 1: Draft Agreement** (Notary)
- Both parties attend notary office
- Disclose all assets + debts
- Notary drafts postnup deed (Akta Perjanjian Perkawinan)

**Step 2: Notarization**
- Both parties sign before notary + 2 witnesses
- Notary registers deed in their system
- Legal effect begins immediately

**Step 3: Report to Authorities**
- **Non-Muslims**: Report to Dinas Kependudukan dan Catatan Sipil
- **Muslims**: Report to KUA
- Bring: IDs, family card, marriage certificate, notarized postnup deed

**Step 4: Receive Confirmation**
- Authorities issue confirmation letter (not marriage certificate amendment)
- Postnup is valid even without this step (but recommended for clarity)

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks total
**Cost**: IDR 8M - 15M (higher than prenup due to complexity)

---

#### **Critical Legal Notes**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations of Postnuptial Agreements**:

1. **NOT Retroactive**: Cannot affect assets already classified as harta bersama (joint property)
   - Solution: Include asset transfer clauses (may trigger tax)

2. **Creditor Protection**: Cannot defraud existing creditors
   - Postnup signed to avoid debt collection = voidable

3. **Good Faith Required**: Both parties must consent voluntarily
   - Coerced postnup = voidable (like prenup)

4. **Land Purchase Timing**: Some BPN offices require postnup BEFORE applying for Hak Milik
   - Check local BPN requirements first

---

### **3.5 Property Rights in Mixed Marriages**

#### **Without Prenup/Postnup (Default Rule)**

**Article 35 UU 1/1974**:
> *"Property acquired during marriage becomes joint property (harta bersama)."*

**Impact on Mixed Marriages**:
- Indonesian spouse **CANNOT** buy land with Hak Milik
- Reason: Foreign spouse has 50% beneficial interest = violates UUPA Article 21
- Existing Hak Milik owned by Indonesian spouse before marriage is safe (harta bawaan)

**What happens if Indonesian spouse buys land anyway?**:
- Land office (BPN) will reject application if they discover mixed marriage
- If land is purchased (BPN didn't check), certificate is **voidable**
- Government can revoke certificate retroactively

---

#### **With Prenup/Postnup**

**Asset Separation Effect**:
- Indonesian spouse can buy Hak Milik in sole name
- Foreign spouse has **zero** legal claim (per prenup/postnup)
- BPN requires copy of prenup/postnup during land purchase

**Required Documents for Hak Milik Purchase (Mixed Marriage)**:
1. Indonesian spouse's KTP
2. Marriage certificate
3. Foreign spouse's passport
4. **Notarized prenup/postnup deed** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
5. Letter from foreign spouse waiving rights (some BPN offices require)

---

#### **Death of Indonesian Spouse**

**With Prenup/Postnup**:
- Hak Milik land is **100% Indonesian spouse's sole property**
- Foreign spouse inherits per will (if any)
- **BUT**: Foreign spouse must transfer Hak Milik to Indonesian heir within **12 months** (UUPA Article 21)
- Failure to transfer ‚Üí land reverts to State

**Without Prenup/Postnup**:
- Hak Milik land is 50% joint property
- Foreign spouse inherits 50% ‚Üí **MUST sell within 12 months**
- 50% children's inheritance (if Indonesian citizens) ‚Üí keep
- 50% foreign spouse ‚Üí convert to Hak Pakai or sell

<a name="supreme-court-precedents"></a>
## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Supreme Court Precedents (Landmark Cases)

### **4.1 MA 3020 K/Pdt/2014 - The Nominee Ruling**

#### **Case Summary**
- **Court**: Mahkamah Agung (Supreme Court of Indonesia)
- **Case No.**: 3020 K/Pdt/2014
- **Date**: 2014
- **Issue**: Validity of nominee agreement for land ownership by foreigner

#### **Facts**
- Foreign national used Indonesian "nominee" to purchase land (Hak Milik)
- Nominee later sold property to third party
- Foreigner sued to recover property + money paid

#### **Supreme Court Ruling**

**Holding**:
> *"Nominee agreements for land ownership are illegal and void under Article 26(2) UUPA. Such agreements violate the 'lawful cause' requirement of Article 1320 KUHPerdata. The agreement is null and void from the beginning (batal demi hukum)."*

**Consequences**:
1. üö´ Nominee agreement = **void ab initio** (never existed legally)
2. üö´ Foreigner has **ZERO legal claim** to property
3. üö´ Money paid to nominee **NOT recoverable**
4. ‚úÖ Nominee keeps both land AND money
5. ‚úÖ Third-party buyer (if any) gets clear title

**Precedential Value**:
- Binding on all lower courts
- Cited in 140+ subsequent cases
- **0% success rate** for foreigners in nominee disputes

---

### **4.2 SEMA No. 10/2020 - Legal vs Beneficial Owner**

#### **Document Type**
- **SEMA** = Surat Edaran Mahkamah Agung (Supreme Court Circular)
- **Function**: Guidance to lower courts (persuasive, not binding)

#### **Key Ruling**

> *"Only the legal owner (registered on certificate) has enforceable property rights. Beneficial ownership claims (based on nominee agreements or verbal promises) have no legal standing."*

**Practical Impact**:
- Courts will NOT recognize "beneficial owner" claims by foreigners
- Certificate holder = sole legal owner
- Nominee can sell/mortgage property without foreigner's consent
- Foreigner cannot sue nominee for breach of trust (no legal relationship exists)

---

### **4.3 Constitutional Court 69/PUU-XIII/2015 - Postnuptial Legalization**

#### **Case Details**
- **Court**: Mahkamah Konstitusi (Constitutional Court)
- **Case No.**: 69/PUU-XIII/2015
- **Decision Date**: October 27, 2015
- **Effective**: May 2017 (Ministry clarification)

#### **Issue**
Article 29 UU 1/1974 restricted nuptial agreements to "before or during marriage." Petitioners argued this violated:
- Right to legal certainty
- Right to property protection
- Gender equality (disproportionately affected women in mixed marriages)

#### **Holding**

**Court Ruled**: Article 29 is **unconstitutional** as written

**New Interpretation**:
> *"Nuptial agreements may be made before, during, or AFTER marriage, as long as the parties are still legally married and mutually consent."*

**Rationale**:
1. Protects property rights in changing circumstances
2. Provides legal certainty for mixed-marriage couples
3. Allows correction of oversight (forgot prenup)
4. Aligns with Civil Code provisions on property division

**Effect**:
- ‚úÖ Postnuptial agreements now LEGAL
- ‚úÖ Married couples can modify property arrangements
- ‚úÖ Indonesian spouse in mixed marriage can buy Hak Milik after marriage (with postnup)

---

### **4.4 Lower Court Cases (Examples)**

#### **Case 274/Pdt.G/2020/PN Dps (Denpasar District Court)**

**Facts**:
- Australian national used nominee to buy villa in Bali
- Nominee refused to transfer property after full payment
- Australian sued for specific performance + damages

**Ruling**:
- Nominee agreement **void** (violates UUPA Article 21)
- Australian has no legal standing to sue
- Case **dismissed**
- Australian lost USD 280,000

**Lesson**: Denpasar court strictly follows MA 3020 K/Pdt/2014 precedent

---

#### **Case 1606/Pdt.G/2024/PN Dps - Julian Petroulas (Ongoing)**

**Facts** (as of October 2025):
- Australian Julian Petroulas leased 1.1 hectare in Canggu
- YouTube video claimed he "owned" land
- Indonesian Immigration banned him from Indonesia (November 21, 2024)
- Petroulas suing French national seller for alleged tax fraud

**Status**: Ongoing civil litigation (not criminal charges)

**Relevance**:
- Demonstrates strict enforcement of UUPA
- Immigration ban for misrepresenting land ownership
- Civil suit for lease dispute (not nominee arrangement)

---

<a name="enforcement-actions"></a>
## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Recent Enforcement Actions (2024-2025)

### **5.1 Julian Petroulas Case (2024)**

#### **Timeline**

**June 28, 2024**: Petroulas uploads YouTube video claiming to "own" 1.1 hectare in Canggu, Bali

**July-August 2024**: Video goes viral, Indonesian authorities investigate

**November 21, 2024**:
- **Immigration Ban**: Saffar M. Godam (Acting Director General of Immigration) bans Petroulas from Indonesia
- **Reason**: Used visa on arrival (not investment visa), misrepresented land ownership

**December 19, 2024**: Official announcement of ban by Directorate General of Immigration

**Current Status (2025)**:
- Petroulas banned from entering Indonesia
- Civil litigation ongoing (Case 1606/Pdt.G/2024/PN Dps)
- Suing French national seller for tax fraud
- No criminal charges filed

---

#### **Legal Violations**

**Immigration Violations**:
- ‚úÖ Used **Visa on Arrival** (VOA) - June 17-July 7, 2024; July 20-August 8, 2024
- ‚ùå VOA does NOT permit:
  - Land ownership
  - Business operations
  - Long-term residence

**Public Misrepresentation**:
- Claimed to "own" land in YouTube video
- Actually had **leasehold agreement** (Hak Sewa)
- Violated truth in advertising + damaged Indonesia's investment image

**Official Statement**:
> *"Mr. Petroulas' videos had the potential to damage Indonesia's image as an investment destination. Immigration investigation confirmed he did not own any land or businesses in Bali."* - Saffar M. Godam

---

#### **Lessons for Bali Zero Clients**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Do NOT**:
1. Misrepresent leasehold as "ownership" in public
2. Use tourist visa for business/investment activities
3. Post social media bragging about "buying" land (attracts scrutiny)
4. Assume lease = ownership (legally distinct)

‚úÖ **DO**:
1. Use correct terminology ("lease" not "own")
2. Obtain proper visa (KITAS investor, not VOA)
3. Keep low profile on social media re: property
4. Consult legal advisor before public statements

---

### **5.2 Operation Wira Waspada (2023-2024)**

- üö´ **267 company licenses revoked** (PT PMA shell companies)
- üìä **Enhanced BKPM-Immigration coordination** (cross-check visa vs business activity)

---

#### **Geographic Focus**

---

### **5.3 Client Warnings**

#### **If You Currently Have Nominee Arrangement**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Immediate Risks**:
