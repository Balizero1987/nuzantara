## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Family Law - Divorce & Property Division

### **7.1 Harta Bersama (Joint Property)**

**Legal Basis**:
- Article 35(1), Law No. 1/1974 on Marriage
- Article 128, Indonesian Civil Code
- Article 97, Compilation of Islamic Law (KHI)

**Principle**:
> "All assets acquired during marriage are joint property (harta bersama) and must be divided equally upon divorce."

---

### **7.2 Separate Property (Harta Bawaan)**

**Definition**: Property owned BEFORE marriage or acquired during marriage through:
- Inheritance
- Gifts addressed specifically to one spouse
- Property designated as separate in prenuptial agreement

**Effect**: NOT subject to division upon divorce (remains with original owner)

---

### **7.3 Property Division Process**

#### **Amicable Settlement (Preferred)**

**Step 1**: Spouses agree on asset list
**Step 2**: Negotiate division (50/50 or alternative arrangement)
**Step 3**: Sign settlement agreement before notary
**Step 4**: Submit to court for approval
**Step 5**: Execute transfer (land titles, bank accounts, etc.)

**Timeline**: 1-3 months
**Cost**: IDR 10M - 30M (notary + court fees + property transfer costs)

---

#### **Court-Ordered Division (If No Agreement)**

**Step 1**: Divorce petition filed (includes property division claim)
**Step 2**: Court appoints assessor (penilai) to value assets
**Step 3**: Court hearing (both parties present evidence of contributions)
**Step 4**: Court judgment (typically 50/50 split unless special circumstances)
**Step 5**: Execution (court orders transfer of assets)

**Timeline**: 6-18 months
**Cost**: IDR 25M - 100M (lawyer fees + court costs + assessor fees)

---

### **7.4 Foreign Assets Considerations**

**Problem**: Indonesian court cannot directly order foreign asset transfers

**Solution**:
- Indonesian court judgment ‚Üí **Recognized in foreign court** (if treaty exists)
- Spouse must enforce judgment abroad (separate legal proceedings)
- Assets in non-treaty countries may be unenforceable

**Example**:
- Couple divorces in Indonesia
- Court orders division of Australian property
- Winning spouse must file enforcement action in Australian court
- Australian court recognizes Indonesian judgment (reciprocal enforcement treaty exists)

---

### **7.5 Prenuptial Agreement Override**

**Effect of Valid Prenuptial Agreement**:
- ‚ùå NO harta bersama created during marriage
- ‚ùå Each spouse keeps assets acquired during marriage in own name
- ‚úÖ Court CANNOT order division of separate property

**Example**:
- Indonesian spouse buys land worth IDR 5 billion during marriage (with prenup)
- Land remains **100% Indonesian spouse's property** (not 50/50)
- Foreign spouse has ZERO claim upon divorce

**CRITICAL**: This is why prenups are essential for mixed marriages

---

### **7.6 Child Custody & Property**

**Indonesian Law Principle**: Child's best interest

**Typical Arrangement**:
- Mother gets custody of children <12 years old (preference, not absolute)
- Father pays child support (negotiated or court-ordered)
- Family home may be awarded to custodial parent (until children reach 18)

**Foreign Spouse Custody**:
- If foreign spouse awarded custody ‚Üí Must remain in Indonesia (usually)
- If foreign spouse wants to relocate children abroad ‚Üí Requires Indonesian spouse's consent OR court order
- Court considers: Child's welfare, connection to Indonesia, ability to visit non-custodial parent
