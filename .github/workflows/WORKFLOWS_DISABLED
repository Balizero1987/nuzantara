# CI/CD WORKFLOWS TEMPORARILY DISABLED
# Date: 2025-10-14
# Reason: QUADRUPLE-AI system integration - testing required before deployment
#
# To re-enable workflows:
# 1. Delete this file
# 2. Test the QUADRUPLE-AI routing locally first
# 3. Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in Cloud Run environment
# 4. Verify DEVAI_ENDPOINT is configured (optional, will fallback to Sonnet)
#
# Changes in this commit:
# - Integrated Intelligent Router into /bali-zero/chat endpoint
# - Added Claude Haiku 3.5 for greetings/casual (60% traffic, 12x cheaper)
# - Added Claude Sonnet 4.5 for business queries (35% traffic, premium quality)
# - Added DevAI Qwen 2.5 Coder routing (5% traffic, code specialist)
# - LLAMA 3.1 used for intent classification + fallback
# - Added ai_used field to BaliZeroResponse
# - Removed all duplicated greeting detection code
# - Fixed structural damage in main_cloud.py
#
# Cost impact:
# - 54% cost savings vs all-Sonnet approach
# - Monthly: $25-55 for 3,000 requests (vs $90 all-Sonnet)
#
# DO NOT DEPLOY until local testing confirms all 4 AIs work correctly!
