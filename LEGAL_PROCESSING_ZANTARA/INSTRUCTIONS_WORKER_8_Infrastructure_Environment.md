## ⚠️ SPECIAL NOTE: CIVIL CODE

The Civil Code is **HUGE** (~1700+ articles). Processing strategy:

1. **Phase 1:** Process Books I-IV (Persons, Property, Obligations, Evidence)
2. **Chunk by topic cluster:** Group related Pasal (e.g., all marriage law together)
3. **Create index chunks:** Overview chunks for major sections
4. **Cross-reference heavily:** Civil Code connects to all other laws

This will take **4-5 days alone** for the Civil Code.
