husband may not deny the legitimacy of the child on the basis of his physical infirmities. (Bw.258, 1865;
Civ.312v.)
Article 253. A husband may not deny the legitimacy of the child upon grounds of adultery, unless the
birth was concealed from him; in which case he may rely upon adultery as proof that he is not the father
of the child. (Bw.1965; Civ.313)
Article 254. He may deny the legitimacy of a child, who is born more than three hundred days after the
judgment granting separation has obtained legal validity, without prejudice to the rights of the wife to
submit evidence which is admissible in order to prove that her husband is the father of the child. If the
husband's denial has been declared valid, the reconciliation of the spouses shall not result in the child
being granted legitimate status.
Article 255. A child who is born three hundred days after the dissolution of the marriage shall be deemed
to be illegitimate. (Bw.106, 199; Civ.315) (Supplemented by S.23-31) If the parents of a child, who *76 is
born three hundred days following the dissolution of their marriage, remarry one another, the child may
not obtain legitimate status in any way other than that which is pursuant to the stipulations in the second
section of this title.
Article 256. In the events described in articles 251, 252, 253 and 254, a husband shall deny the
legitimacy of child: within a period of one month, if he is located in the birth place of the child, or within
the vicinity thereof; within two months after his return, if he has been absent; in the event that the birth of
the child has been concealed from him, within two months after the discovery of the concealment. All
deeds executed outside court, containing the denial by a husband, shall be deemed invalid, unless they
are followed within two months by a legal claim. If the husband, following the denial, executes a deed
outside court, and passes away within the stipulated period, his descendants shall be granted a new
period of two months within which to file their legal claim. (Bw.257v., 1058, 1979; Civ.316, 318; See
S.46-67 below)
Article 257. The legal claim filed by a husband, shall lapse, if the heirs do not pursue same within two
months, effective from the date of death of the husband. (Bw.259, 1979)
Article 258. If a husband passes away, prior to exercising such right , but during the stipulated period,
his heirs may not deny the legitimacy of the child otherwise than in the circumstances described in
article 252. The legal claim disputing the legitimacy of the child shall be filed within a period of two
months, effective as of the time that possession of the assets of the husband is taken by the child, or
effective as of the time that the inheritance of such assets by others is obstructed by the child. (Bw.259,
472, 833v.; Civ.317)
Article 259. In the event that the heirs, pursuant to articles 256, 257 and 258, are authorized to file or
continue a legal claim disputing the legitimacy of a child, this must be done within a period of one year, if
one or more reside outside Indonesia. In the event of war at sea, the term shall be doubled.
Pursuant to S.46-67 effective as July 13, 1946, the following is stipulated: Article 1. (1) The judge, with
whom a legal claim denying the legitimacy of a child is or may be filed, shall, until a date to be stipulated
in the future by the Governor General, be authorized to extend the periods stipulated in articles 256
through 259 of the Civil Code regarding the denial of the legitimacy of a child pursuant to a deed
executed outside court, regarding the filing of such legal claim for another stipulated term or until a fixed
point in time, if the legal claim cannot reasonably be filed within the aforementioned periods due to
extenuating circumstances *77 (2) The extension referred to in the first paragraph may be granted by a
judge ex officio.
Article 260. All legal claims for the denial of the legitimacy of a child shall be addressed to the special
guardian to whom the child is entrusted, and the mother shall be properly summoned in the lawsuit.
(Bw.102, 110, 310, 359, 1920; Civ.318)
Article 261. The descent of legitimate children shall be proven by birth certificates, recorded in the
registers of the civil registry. (BS.34) In the absence of such deed, the uninterrupted possession of a
child's legitimate status shall be sufficient proof for the child. (Bw.13,101,286;BS.37;Civ.319v.)
Article 262. The possession of such status shall be proven by events, which either together or
separately, indicate the relationship by descent and kinship between a specific individual and the

lineage to which he purports to belong. The most significant of these events are, among others: that
such individual has always used the name of the father from whom he claims to be descended ; (Bw.10;
BS.30) that the father has treated him as his child and as such has provided for his education,
maintenance and means of living; (Bw.104, 298v.) that the public has acknowledged him as the father's
child; that the next of kin have acknowledged him as such. (Bw.102; Civ.321)
Article 263. No one can claim a status that is in violation of that which is stipulated and has been
granted in his birth certificate, while at the same time no one can dispute the status held by an individual
pursuant to his birth certificate. (Bw.102; Civ.322)
Article 264. In the absence of such certificate and uninterrupted possession of status, or if the child is
recorded in the registers under false names, or if the child's natural father or mother are unknown, then
the descent may be proven by witnesses. This proof may only be admitted if there is initial written proof;
or if the allegations or indications, resulting from events which have not been disputed, can be
considered sufficiently significant to admit such as evidence. (Bw.288, 1922; BS.27; Civ.323)
Article 265. The initial written proof shall be found in family documents, registers and household
documents belonging to the father or the mother, or also in public or private deeds belonging to an
individual, who is involved in the dispute, or if still alive, would have had an interest therein. (Bw.268,
1881, 1902; BS.27; Civ.324)
Article 266. Proof against this may be in any suitable form which indicates that the individual claiming
descent is not the child of the woman who he claims to be his mother, or also, in the event that it is
proven that she is his mother, is not the child of such woman's husband. *78 (Bw.264v., 286v.; Civ.325)
Article 267. A civil judge only shall be authorized to deal with appeals in respect of status. (Bw.268,
1920; Civ.326)
Article 268. A lawsuit in respect of false representation of status which carries the penalty of corporal
punishment may not be filed, prior to the passing of the final judgment regarding the dispute over such
status. The prosecution counsel shall, however, be entitled to file a lawsuit in respect of false
representation of status which carries the penalty of corporal punishment, if the interested parties
remain silent, provided that there is initial written proof pursuant to article 265, and if it has been decided
from the start that there is such indication of initial proof. (Bw.268, second paragraph not applicable to
Chinese, see Chinese 1-1 g) In the last instance, the process of the public lawsuit shall not be
suspended by any civil suit. (AB.30; Bw.267, 1918;BS.27v.; Sv.409; Sw.529; Civ.337)
Article 269. In relation to children, the lawsuit to appeal a certain status shall not be subject to any
prescribed period of limitation. (Bw.1967, 1986; Civ.328)
Article 270. Such a lawsuit may only be filed by the heirs of the child who has not appealed his status in
the event that the child died when he was still a minor, or within three years of his reaching the age of
majority. (Bw.258, 883, 1058; Civ.329)
Article 271. The heirs, may, however, resume such lawsuits, if they have been instituted by the child,
unless the suit has not been prosecuted within three years after the filing of the last deed. (Bw.257, 833;
Rv.273v.; Civ.330)
Article 271a. (Supplemented by S.37-595, effective as of January 1, 1939) An individual whose claim for
invocation of a certain status has been granted or who has been permitted to deny the legitimacy of a
child, shall have the judgment recorded after it has obtained legal validity in the current registers of
births at the location where the birth was recorded. This shall be mentioned in the margin of the birth
certificate.
Section 2
Concerning the legitimization of natural children
Article 272. Children conceived outside marriage, with the exception of those who have been conceived
in an adulterous or incestuous relationship, shall be legitimized by the ensuing marriage of their father
and mother, if the latter-mentioned have acknowledged them legally prior to the concluding of the

marriage, or if the acknowledgment took place at the time of execution of the marriage certificate.
(Bw.40, 275, 277, 280v., 862, 867; BS.53, 61-9; Civ.331)
Article 273. Children, who are born of parents, between whom no marriage would have existed without
dispensation granted by the Governor General, cannot be legitimized other than by acknowledgment in
the marriage certificate. (Bw.29,31,280,283)
Article 274. If the parents, prior to or at the time of entering into the marriage, fail to acknowledge their
natural children, they may subsequently reverse their position by letter of legitimization, granted by the
Governor General, following the advice issued by the Supreme Court. (Ov.16; Bw.276;BS.61-9; Bb.515,
4941, 6038, 6089, 7488, 8653, 13416, 13421, 13603, 13604, 13605)
Article 275. (Amended by S.96-115) In a manner similar to that stipulated in the previous article, the
following natural and legally acknowledged children may also be legitimized:
1. children born of parents who cannot enter into their intended marriage as a result of one of the
parents passing away;
2. children born of a mother, who is of Indonesian descent or descended from another similar
indigenous group; if the mother has passed away, or in the event that there are significant objections -at
the discretion of the Governor General- to the marriage of the parents. (Bw.272, 276, 278)
Article 276. (Amended by S.96-115) In the events, mentioned in the two previous articles, the supreme
court shall if it deems fit, hear or instruct that the blood relatives of the applicants be heard, prior to
issuing its advice, and shall also order that the request for legitimization shall be announced through the
appointed public newspapers. (Bw.290)
Article 277. (Amended by S.27-31 see also 290, 421) *80 Legitimization, either by the ensuing marriage
of the parents, or in the events set out in article 274, pursuant to the issuance of letters of legitimization,
shall result in the same legal regulations being applicable to the children as those which are applicable
to children born during marriage. (Bw.852; Civ.333)
Article 278. (Amended by S.96-115) In the events described in article 275, the legitimization shall only
be valid as of the date that the letters are issued by the Governor General; this shall not jeopardize the
existing legitimate children with respect to their succession as heirs, similarly, this shall not affect the
succession of other blood relatives as heirs, provided that they have approved the issuance of the
letters of legitimization. (Bw.852v.)
Article 279. In the same manner, and pursuant to the same regulations as mentioned in the previous
articles, children who have passed away and who have left descendants, can also be legitimized; in
which event, the legitimization shall benefit their descendants. (Bw.272, 274, 842, 852; Civ.332).
Section 3
Concerning the acknowledgment of natural children
Article 280. The acknowledgment of a natural child shall create a civil relationship between that child
and his father or mother. (Bw.30v., 40, 47, 272v., 306, 319, 328, 353, 363,862, 871, 873, 908, 916)
Article 281. The acknowledgment of a natural child can take place pursuant to any kind of authentic
deed, if such has not already taken place by birth certificate, or at the execution of the marriage.
(Not.37a) Such acknowledgment can also take place pursuant to a deed, drawn up by the official of the
civil registry, and recorded as at the date of signing in the birth registry. Such acknowledgment shall be
mentioned in the margin of the birth certificate, if it is available. (Bw.40, 272, 862, 908, 1868; BS.41, 53,
61-9; Civ.62, 334) If the acknowledgment of the child was contained in another authentic deed, then
each interested party may demand that it shall be mentioned in the margin of the birth certificate. Under
no circumstances shall absence of the notation of an acknowledgment in the margin of the birth
certificate be grounds for disputing the status granted.
Article 282. The acknowledgment by a minor of a natural child shall be deemed to be invalid unless the
minor has reached the age of nineteen years, and the acknowledgment is not the result of duress, error,

deceit or enticement. (BS.42) A minor daughter, shall, however, be able to acknowledge a natural child
prior to her reaching the age of nineteen years. (Bw.29, 108, 330, 446, 452, 1321, 1446, 1449)
Article 283. Children conceived in an adulterous or incestuous relationship may not be acknowledged,
without prejudice to the stipulation in article 273, with regard to the latter mentioned. (Bw.30v., 41, 252v.,

Article 284. (Amended by S.96-108) No acknowledgment of a natural child shall, during the lifetime of
the mother, notwithstanding that she may be of Indonesian descent or descended from a similar
indigenous group, be accepted, if the mother does not approve the acknowledgment. (Bw.280v., 354) If
such child is acknowledged after the death of the *82 mother, such acknowledgment shall have no
consequences other than those which relate to the father. (Bw.288; Civ.336) Acknowledgment of a
natural child, whose mother is of Indonesian descent or descended from a similar indigenous group,
shall annul the civil relationship arising from natural descent, without prejudice to the consequences of
an acknowledgment by the mother, in the event that she is granted the authority due to the ensuing
marriage to the father.
Article 285. Acknowledgment which takes place in the course of the marriage by one of the spouses, in
order to benefit the natural child, which he, prior to his marriage has conceived with a person other than
his spouse, shall not jeopardize that spouse, nor shall it be detrimental to the children born of that
marriage. Such acknowledgment, shall, however, have consequences after the dissolution of that
marriage, if there are no remaining descendants from the marriage. Bw.199, 277; Civ.337)
Article 286. Any acknowledgment by the father or the mother, including the claim to a certain status by
the child may be disputed by those who have an interest therein. (Bw.261v., 282; Civ.339)
Article 287. Investigation of paternity shall be prohibited. (Amended by S.17-497) However, in the event
that a misdemeanor as described in articles 285 through 288, 294 or 332 of the penal code, was carried
out which resulted in the pregnancy, then the guilty party, can, upon being charged by the interested
parties, be declared to be the father of the child. (Bw.252v.; Civ.340)
Article 288. Investigation of maternity shall be permitted. In this regard the child is required to prove that
he or she was borne by that mother. No proof by witnesses with respect to the child shall be admitted,
unless there already exists initial written proof. (Bw.265, 1902, 1914; Civ.341)
Article 289. No child shall be permitted to investigate his or her paternity or maternity, in the events,
where pursuant to article 283, no acknowledgment can take place. (Civ.342).
Chapter XIII
Concerning the relationship by blood and marriage
Article 290. A blood relationship subsists between persons of whom one descends from the other, or
between persons who have a common ancestor. A blood relationship shall be calculated by the number
of births; each birth shall be referred to as a degree. (Bw.30, 872v., 877, Civ.735)
Article 291. The succession of degrees constitutes a line of descent. A direct line refers to the
succession of degrees between individuals of whom one descends from the other; a collateral line, shall
be interpreted as the succession of degrees among individuals, who do not descend one from the other,
but who have a common ancestor. (Civ.726)
Article 292. A direct line shall be a descerding and ascending line. The former subsists between an
individual and his descendants; the latter subsists between an individual and his ascendants. (Bw.842,
850, 852v., 857; Civ.736)
Article 293. One can calculate in the direct line, the number of degrees as well as births there are
among the individuals; As such, in the descending line, descent from the father to the son, is in the first
degree; and from the grandfather to the grandson is in the second, and so forth; and conversely, in the
ascending line, the ascent from the son and grandson to father and grandfather shall be in the first or
second degree and thereafter accordingly. (Civ.737)

Article 294. In the collateral line the degrees shall be calculated by the number of births, first between
one blood relative and the closest common ancestor, and thereafter between them and the other blood
relative; as such two brothers shall exist in relation to one another in the second degree, uncles and
cousins in the third, nephews in the fourth etc. (Bw.850; Civ.738)
Article 295. Relationship by marriage is the relationship resulting from a marriage, between one of the
spouses and the blood relatives of the other. No relationship by marriage shall exist between the mutual
blood relatives of the spouses. (Bw.30v., 322, 376)
Article 296. The degrees of relationship by marriage shall be calculated in the same manner as that
adopted in blood relationships. (Bw.293)
Article 297. The dissolution of a marriage shall not invalidate the relationship by marriage between one
of the spouses and the blood relatives of the other. (ISR.9; Bw.30v., 199, 322-2,323).

be under their parental authority until he comes of age, to the extent that they are not relieved of such or
dismissed. (Bw.21,35v., 104, 230, 330, 419, 424, 426, 430, 1367; Civ.372)
Article 300. (Amended by S.27-31 see also 390, 421) Except in the event of relief or dismissal and the
provisions regarding the separation from bed and board, only the father shall exercise this authority. In
the event that the father is incapable of exercising parental authority, such authority may be exercised

incapable or incompetent, a guardian shall be appointed by the court of justice pursuant to article 359.
(Bw.105, 230, 451, 496; Civ.373) The original article 301 is revoked pursuant to S.27-31 see also 390,

justice.
Article 302. (Amended by S.27-31 see also 390, 421) In the event that the individual, who exercises

may, at the person's request or at the request of the guardian council, if so requested by it for his
benefit, place the child for a specific period of time in a government or private institution designated by
the court of justice. Such placement shall take place at the expense of the individual who exercises
parental authority, or if he is unable to do so at the expense of the child; the child shall not be placed for

more than six successive months, if the child has not reached the age of fourteen years during the
placement, or if the child has reached such age at that time, for a duration of no longer than one year
and in any event not after he reaches adulthood. The court of justice shall not order the placement until
after the hearing of the guardian council, and without prejudice to the provisions of the first paragraph of
article 303, the hearing of the child; and if one of the parents has not lost his or her parental authority,

shall be applicable to this latter mentioned hearing.
Article 303. (Amended by S.27 see also 390, 421) Failure of the child to appear on the date stipulated
for the hearing, shall result in the court of justice postponing the investigation to a date to be stipulated
in the future and the said court shall order that the child shall be brought to appear before it on that date
by a process server or public authority official; this order shall be enforced upon order of the prosecution
counsel; if the child has not yet appeared on the later date, then the court of justice may order or deny
the placement without having heard the child. In this regard, no legal formalities shall be taken into

child, may at any time be released from the institution referred to in *89 article 302, if the reason for the
placement no longer exists, or if his physical or mental state does not require him to stay any longer.
The individual, who exercises the parental authority, shall always be entitled to expedite the placement.
In order to obtain an extension of the time of the placement, the provisions of articles 302 and 303 shall
be taken into consideration. The court of justice shall order such extension which shall not exceed six
successive months; the order shall not be issued until after the head of the institution, where the child

children, with the provision that the management thereof shall be carried out by one or more managers
appointed thereto, other than the individual who exercises the parental authority. If the aforementioned
management, for any reason, shall be revoked, then the assets in question shall be transferred to be

the father or the mother who exercises parental authority or guardianship, in circumstances where the
other parent is deceased or has been relieved of parental authority or guardianship, shall not affect
enjoyment of the proceeds. (Bw.127, 206, 237, 299v.,308,313,321,390,496,756v., 809,840;

provide one or the other stipulated security, the Orphans' Chamber shall register the mortgage at the
guardian's expense. (Bw.337) If the guardian objects to this registration on grounds that it was

be permitted to request that the security provided by him be reduced, if, through no fault of his, during
his management, there has been a significant reduction in the assets of the minor. In the event of
dispute over this between the *111 guardian and the Orphans' Chamber, the court of justice shall also

Chamber, that such management shall also remain the responsibility of the guardian, provided that he
submits to the Orphans' Chamber all funds, precious items and negotiable instruments, belonging to the
minor; and in this regard the Orphans' Chamber shall provide the guardian with the sums necessary to

in accordance with the previous article.
Article 339. (Amended by S.27-31 see also 390, 421) If the guardian leaves Indonesia with the minor, he
may, upon his request, be reinstated in the position of management from which he was removed

thereof shall be regulated according to the local market prices of the last ten years, which shall be
calculated by them, and failing this, it shall be stipulated by experts appointed by the parties or the

Article 757. If, however, the use of proceeds is understood to include use of consumable products, then
it shall suffice if the user of the proceeds, upon termination of the period of use of proceeds, returns the
same amount, kind and value of products, or pays the price at which the products were appraised at the
commencement of the use of proceeds, or pays the value appraised at that particular time.
(Bw.756,761,782,784,786,804v.,822,1273,1755;Civ.587)
Article 758. Use of proceeds may be established for the benefit of one or more specific individuals, for
the purpose of having the enjoyment thereof, whether together or in succession. In the event of

Article 762. The natural fruit and the proceeds of industry, which at the commencement of the use of

depleted by use, such as clothes, linen, house hold furnishings and the like, the user of proceeds shall
be entitled to use the assets for purpose for which they were designated, provided that at the
termination of the use of proceeds, he shall not be obligated to return the assets in a condition which is

owner. (Bw.793; Civ.592)
Article 769. The user of the proceeds may remove stakes from the woods for use in the vineyards, and if

community, or the owners. (AB.15; Bw.767v.; Civ.593)

shall hire out the property or grant a long term lease thereof, or sell or encumber the use of the
proceeds, or dispose of it without charge. He shall, however, whether in the course of his own
enjoyment, or hiring, or long term lease, or disposal, observe the local custom and the custom of the
owners, and shall not change the use of the property to one which shall be detrimental to the owners.
During the term of the hire or long term lease, he shall *229 also, having regard to the different nature
and the purpose of the assets, observe the local customs and the customs of the owners. In the

Article 776. (Amended by S.04-233) The user of the proceeds shall not have any rights whatsoever in

of the amount stipulated in the first paragraph, the current spouse may choose whether to reduce the

made, and their value at the time of the donor's death; one shall calculate the value of all the assets,
after deduction of debts, one shall also calculate the amount that an individual is entitled to claim, in

manner and in the same order of rank as the donees. This lawsuit shall be filed in accordance with the
order of the dates of the transfers, commencing with the most recent transfer. The lawsuit for reduction
or return against third owners shall not take place, to the extent that no other assets have remained with
the donee, which were included in the gift, and these are insufficient to fulfill the legal share of the
inheritance in its entirety, or if the value of the transferred assets cannot be compensated with his
personal assets. This lawsuit shall expire after three years from the date on which the legatee accepted
the inheritance. (Bw.920,924; Civ.930)

individual's share in the assets shall be allocated by division and in the event that there are grounds
therefor, payment shall be made of a sum equal to the share due. If the interested parties do not
approve such allocations, the land shall be divided into the number of parcels which equals the number
of heirs or branches of the main stock, and the allocation of the parcels shall be decided by lottery. The

Chapter XX
Concerning pledges
Article 1150. A pledge is a right which is obtained by a creditor in a movable asset, which has been
provided to him by the debtor or his representative, to secure a debt, and which entitles the creditor

priority over the other creditors with regard to the settlement of the debt; with the exception of the costs
incurred in the sale of the asset and the costs incurred, after the pledge, for the maintenance of the
asset,
which
shall
have
priority.
(Bw.528,1133v.,1139-1

Pursuant to S.75-258, articles 1151-1156 are replaced by the following stipulations:
Article 1151. A pledge agreement shall be proven by the same means as those used for proving a
principal agreement. (Bw.1866v.; Civ.2074)
Article 1152. A pledge right in respect of tangible movable assets and debts payable to bearer shall be
established by placing the pledge in the power of the creditor or a third party, who has been mutually
agreed upon by the parties. It shall not apply to assets, which are left in the power of the debtor or the
pledgor, or which shall be returned if the creditor so desires. (Amended by S.17-497) It shall become
void, if the pledge is no longer controlled by the pledgee. In the event that this occurs as a result of loss
or transfer, he shall have the right to reclaim pursuant to article 1977, paragraph 2, and upon the return
of the assets pledged, the pledge right shall be considered to have never been lost. The absence of
authority of the pledgee to dispose of the assets cannot be denied by the creditor who has taken such
assets in pledge, without prejudice to the right to reclaim by the individual who has lost the asset or from
whom it was taken. (Bw.852, 613,1441,1474; Civ.2076)
Article 1152 bis. In addition to the endorsement, the delivery of the paper shall also be required to
establish the pledge right on bearer paper. (K.110v.,176,191v.,457,508,531v.)

shall be exercised. He may claim written proof of the notification and the consent of the pledgees.
(Bw.613; Civ.2075; Octr.Regl.18,20f, *318 h; etc.)
Article 1154. The creditor shall not appropriate the pledge, if the debtor or the pledgor has not complied
with his obligations. Any stipulations otherwise regulated shall be deemed to be invalid. (AB.23;
Bw.1155v.,1178; Civ.2078)
Article 1155. Unless the parties otherwise stipulate, in the event that the debtor or the pledgor does not
comply with his obligations, the creditor shall be authorized, following the lapse of a specific term or in
the event that no specific term was stipulated, after a summons in respect of compliance, to sell the
pledge in public pursuant to local customs and in accordance with the usual requirements, to settle the
debt which shall include the interest and costs incurred from the proceeds of the sale. (Octr.42) In the
event that the pledge is of commercial items sold at the market or securities traded on the stock market,
then the sale can also take place in such locations, provided that two agents involved in such business
shall act as intermediaries. (Bw.1156,1178; K.62v.)
Article 1156. In the event that the debtor or the pledgor fails to fulfill his obligations, the creditor may
demand in court that the pledge shall be sold to satisfy the debt including the interest and costs, in the
manner to be determined by the judge, or the judge shall admit the creditor's request that the pledge
shall be retained by him, until an amount has been determined in the judgment to pay off the debt and
the interest and costs. With regard to the transfer of the pledge in the events mentioned herein and in
the previous article, the creditor is required to notify the pledgor by not later than the following day if
there is a daily postal service or telegram communication, or else by the first departing mail. Notification
by telegram or registered letter shall be regarded as proper notification. (Bw.1150,1153,1155,1238;
Octr.42;Civ.2078)
Article 1157. The creditor shall be responsible for the loss or the depreciation of the property pledged, to
the extent that this is caused by his negligence. However, the debtor shall be required to compensate
the creditor for the necessary expenses, which the latter-mentioned has incurred in the maintenance of
the land. (Bw.1139-4,1147,1150,1159,1235v.,1243v.,1391,1441,1444v.;Civ.2080)
Article 1158. If a loan is pledged, and interest accrues on this loan, the creditor shall set off the interest
against the amount which is due to him. If no interest accrues on the debt secured by the pledged loan,
then the interest received by the pledgee shall be deducted from the principal sum.
(Bw.1152v.,1155v.,1718,1767; Civ.2081)

Article 1159. The debtor is not authorized to claim the return of the pledged assets unless the pledgee
misuses these, prior to settling the full amount which shall *319 comprise the principal sum as well as
the interest and charges incurred upon the debt which has been secured by the pledge, including the
charges incurred in respect of the maintenance of the pledge. In the event that a second debt arises
between the same debtor and the same creditor, following the pledge, and collectible prior to the
payment, or on the date of the payment of the first debt, the creditor shall not be obliged to dispose of
the property pledged, prior to full settlement of both debts, even though no stipulations have been made
to secure the pledge for payment of the second debt. (Bw.1150,1396,1967; F.57; Civ.2082)
Article 1160. The pledge cannot be divided, notwithstanding that the debt among the heirs of the debtor
or of the creditor can be divided. The heir of the debtor who has paid his share of the debt, cannot claim
the return of his share in the pledge until the debt has been fully settled. At the same time the heir of a
creditor who has received his share in the debt, cannot return the pledge thereby jeopardizing the coheirs who have not been paid yet. (Bw.1286v.,1402-3; Civ.273)

over the mortgages which the buyer, within that time period, shall have permitted on the asset.
(Bw.1180; Civ.2103-1, 2108)
Article 1183. The same provision shall apply, if in the deed regarding separation of assets a mortgage is

protection of the designated assets. Even in this instance, a registration, carried out within eight days

permitted on the asset. (Bw.1084; civ.2103-3,2109)

authority, either to lease out the encumbered asset without the creditor's consent, or with regard to the
manner in which, or regarding the time period during which such may be leased, or in relation to the
advance payment of the rent, such a stipulation shall not only be binding between the parties, but may
also be enforced upon the lessee by the creditor who has registered such stipulation in the public
registers. (Oogstv.21) This shall not prejudice the provisions of article 1341, which, in the event that
there are grounds therefor, may be invoked by all creditors, regardless of whether or not there are any
limitations stipulated in the lease agreement or advance payment. (Bw.1225,1548,1576; Rv.507)
Article 1186. To implement the registration, the creditor, shall, either personally or through a third party,

article, the second paragraph of article 1178 and the second paragraph of article 1210 could have been

Article 1187. The registrar shall keep the docket, noted on the authentic copy of the title, pursuant to
which registration is required, for the purpose of registering such on the date of the filing. On the same
day, he shall return, to the individual who has requested the registration, the other or second docket, at
the bottom of which he shall have noted the date of the filing. If such is demanded, he shall, *326 not

filing documents or daily register; the dockets shall be separately registered. The documents filed for
publication shall be bound and kept carefully in one volume, the documents for registration in a second
volume, and the deeds for deletion and cancellation in a third volume. These volumes shall furthermore
be formatted into separate book volumes, and on their spines the number of the volume and the time

period that it covers shall be recorded, as well as the first and last number of the documents contained
therein. The Governor General shall regulate the time periods, pursuant to which the documents, as
aforementioned, shall be made into volumes. The date of filing, the volume and number of the register of
filing shall be noted on each document filed.

shall apply to these dockets. (Bw.1107v.,1190,1225; Civ.2111)
Article 1189. The individual, who has instructed that the registration be effected, and his representatives,

the prior sale of the assets held by the original debtor which are also mortgaged. (Bw.1833; Civ.2170v.)

mortgage creditor. (Ov.32; Bw.1211v.,1216; Rv.493v.)

could result in the reduction or loss of the security of the rightful parties, then they shall be entitled to
demand in court that the unpaid purchase price shall immediately be settled and invested, whether in
mortgage registrations regarding other immovable assets, or registrations in the main ledger of the
national actual debt, or debentures charged to Indonesia, one and another, in the same relation and
under the same stipulations, as if the purchase price has been retained by the buyer or his successors;
the above shall be without prejudice to any compensation of costs, damages and interest, in the event
that there are grounds therefor. In the event that the request for immediate settlement mentioned in the
previous paragraph, shall be admitted, the judge shall also nominate a competent individual, who shall

beneficially arranged, or other rightful parties. (Bw.409v.)

that the creditors may retain their right to the remainder of the unpaid purchase price after the final
computation. (Bw.1186v.,1225)

Concerning contracts to provide something
Article 1235. Contracts to provide something include the obligation to deliver the goods and to maintain
such, until the time of the delivery, as they would be maintained if in the care of a good head of the
household. The extent of the latter-mentioned obligation more or less depends on specific agreements,
the consequences of which shall be referred to in the relevant titles. (Bw.105, 385, 612v., 784, 1033,
1157, 1356, 1444v., 1550-1, 1706v. 1715, 1744, 1801; Civ. 1136v.)

Article 1237. With regard to an agreement to provide something, effective as of the conclusion of the

goods shall arise from the time of the default. (Bw.1264, 1275, 1391, 14444, 1460, 1481v., 1545, 1553,
1605, 1648, 1708, 1745v.; Civ. 1138)
Article 1238. The debtor shall be declared to have defaulted, either by an order or other such similar

1139)
Section 5
Conditional Obligations
Article 1253. An obligation is conditional if it is conditioned upon an event that may occur and is yet to
occur, be it by way of deferring the obligation’s entry into force or annulling the obligation, depending on
whether such event occurs.

Article 1254. All terms that are intended to do something that cannot be done, something that is contrary
to morality, or something that is prohibited by the law is void and render agreements conditioned upon
them inapplicable.
Article 1255. Terms that are intended to do something that cannot be done do not cause the obligations
that are conditioned upon them to be inapplicable
Article 1256. All obligations are void, if their executions solely depend on the willingness of the person
bound. However if obligation depends on an act whose execution is within the power of that person, and
such act has already occurred then such obligation is valid.
Article 1257. All terms must be fulfilled in the manner intended and meant by the parties concerned.
Article 1258. If an obligation depends on an event that will happen within a certain time, then such term
is deemed not to have existed, if such time has passed while such term may be fulfilled at any time, and
such term is not deemed not to have existed before it is certain that the event will not happen.
Article 1259. If an obligation is conditioned upon the terms that an event will not take place within certain
time, then such term is fulfilled where such time elapses and the event has not taken place. Similarly, if
such term is met, if before such time elapses it is certain that the event will not happen, but the time is
not fixed, then such term is not met before there is certainty that such event will not happen.
Article 1260. Such terms are deemed fulfilled if the debtor prevents the fulfilment of such terms.
Article 1261. If the conditions are met, then such terms apply retroactively to such time the obligation
arises. If the creditor passes before the term is fulfilled, then the rights pass to his successors.
Article 1262. A creditor may take all necessary efforts to prevent losing his rights before such terms are
met.
Article 1263. An obligation with terms of delay is an obligation that depends on a future event and is not
certain to occur, or depends on an event that has already occurred and is not known to the parties.
In the first case, the obligation is not executable until such time the event occurs; in the second case,
the obligation arises when such event arises.
Article 1264. If an obligation depends on deferred terms, then the objects of the obligation remains
within the responsibility of the debtor, who is only obliged to deliver the goods when the terms are met. If
such goods perish beyond the debtor’s fault, then the obligation no longer exists between the parties. If
the object depreciates beyond the debtor’s faults then the creditor may choose: terminate the obligation
or demand delivery of the object in its current state without price reduction.
If the object depreciates due to the fault of the debtor, then the creditor may terminate the obligation or
demand the delivery of the object with compensation.
Article 1265. A void condition is a term, which if met would cause the obligation to become void and
restitute the parties as though the obligation has never existed
This term does not delay the fulfilment of the obligation; it only obliges the creditor to return what he
receives, if such event occurs.
Article 1266. A void condition is deemed to have been included in a reciprocal agreement, where a party
does not fulfil his obligation. In such case, the agreement is not void by law, but voidance must be
requested to the court.
The request must also be done, even though the terms of voidance concerning the non-fulfilment of an
obligation is included in the agreement. If the terms of voidance is not included in the agreement, then
the judge, considering the situation, upon the defendant’s request, has the discretion to fix a timeframe
to fulfil such obligations, but such timeframe may not exceed one month.

Article 1267. Party against whom the obligation is not fulfilled; forces the counterparty to fulfil the
agreement where such fulfilment is still possible, or demand the termination of such agreement, with
compensation of costs, damages and interests.
Section 3

(Bw. 1160, 1300v.; Civ. 1218)
Article 1298. A contract shall not be deemed to be indivisible on the basis that it is a several liability
contract. (Bw. 1283, 1292, 1301v., 1983; Civ. 1219)
Article 1299. A contract which is not divisible shall be executed by the debtor and the creditor, as if such
contract is indivisible; divisibility shall only apply to their heirs who cannot claim the debt, or who are not
obligated to settle such, but only to the extent of the share which they have inherited or for which they
are liable as representatives of the creditor or the debtor. (Bw. 1100v., 1311v., 1390, 1527v., 1721; Civ.
1220)

the debtor in the following matters:
1. in the event that the debt relates to a mortgage; (Bw. 1101v., 1105, 1163, 1198)
2. if the debt comprises specific goods; (Bw. 1083, 1391)
3. with respect to a debt comprising alternative goods, to be selected by the creditor, if one of the goods
proves to be indivisible; (Bw. 1272v.)
4. if, according to the agreement, only one of the heirs is obliged to perform the contract; (Bw. 800, 959,
965, 967).
5. if, either due to the nature of the contract, or due to the goods which form the subject matter, or due to
the intent set out in the contract, it is apparent that it is the parties' intent that the debt shall not be
settled in parts. (Bw. 1297) In the first three instances, the heir who is in possession of the goods owed,
or of the goods which serve as security for the debt, shall be prosecuted for the entire *353 debt, or for
the encumbered goods, without prejudice to his right to recover from the other heirs. In the fourth
instance, only the heir who is liable for the debt may be prosecuted, and in the fifth instance, each heir
can also be prosecuted for the entire debt, without prejudice to the right of the latter-mentioned to
recover from the other heirs. (Civ. 1221)
Article 1301. Each individual, who jointly is responsible for an indivisible debt, is liable for the entire debt,
even though the contract was not concluded subject to several liability. (Bw. 1160, 1163, 1278v., 1297,
1310; Civ. 1222)
Article 1302. The same shall also apply to the heirs of those individuals, who are bound by a similar
contract. (Bw. 1102v., 1310, 1721; Civ. 1223)
Article 1303. Each heir of the creditor may demand the implementation of an indivisible contract in its
entirety. An individual heir shall not discharge the entire debt, or receive the value thereof, instead of the
goods. If only one of the heirs has discharged the debt, or has accepted the value of the goods, the
other heirs shall not claim the indivisible goods, unless they shall have regard to the share of the heir
who has discharged the debt or has received the value thereof. (Bw. 1278, 1289, 1385, 1438, 1721; Civ.
1224).

Section 4
Concerning contracts subject to punishment and penalization
Article 1304. A stipulation in respect of punishment is a stipulation which ensures the execution of a
contract by imposing an obligation on an individual in the event that the contract is not complied with.
(Bw. 1243, 1249; Civ. 1226)
Article 1305. The nullification of the principal contract shall also render the stipulation regarding
punishment void. However, the nullification of the stipulation regarding punishment shall, in no manner,
render the principal contract void. (Bw. 1315, 1317; Civ. 1227)
Article 1306. The creditor, may, instead of invoking the punishment against the debtor who is in breach,
demand the fulfillment of the principal contract.(Civ. 1228)

1229)

the punishment shall be imposed as a result of breach by any one of the heirs of the debtor and the
entire debt may be claimed either from the individual who is in breach, or the respective shares can be
claimed from each heir, without prejudice to their rights to claim compensation from the individual as a
result of whom the punishment has been imposed, regardless of the rights of secured creditors. (Bw.
116, 1285, 1301; Civ. 1232)
Article 1311. In the event that the original contract *355 containing a provision regarding punishment is
divisible, the punishment shall be imposed solely upon the heirs of the debtor who have breached this
contract, and to the extent only of his share in the principal contract, and no lawsuit shall be filed against
the individuals who have complied with the contract. There shall be an exception to this rule if the
provision regarding punishment is included with the intent that performance shall not occur in parts, and
if one of the heirs has obstructed the entire performance of the contract; in this event, the punishment of
the latter-mentioned may be imposed in its entirety, and with respect to the other heirs only in relation to
their shares, without prejudice to their right for compensation. (Bw. 1200, 1306; Civ. 1233)
Article 1312. If a divisible principal contract, which contains a stipulation of indivisible punishment, has

Chapter VII A
Concerning agreements regarding the performance of services
Section 1
General provisions (B.W. 1603X)
Article 1601. With the exception of agreements to perform several services, which are regulated by the
terms and conditions agreed upon and in the absence of such, shall be regulated by custom, there are
two kinds of agreements in which one party covenants to the other to perform services in return for
remuneration, as follows; a labor agreement and a for work. (Bw.1338, 1601a, 1604; AB.15; Civ.1779)
Article 1601a. A labor agreement is an agreement in which one party, the laborer, agrees to render his
services to the other party, the employer, for a specific term in return for remuneration. (Bw. 1603e,
1603y)
Article 1601b. The contract for work is the agreement by which one party, the contractor, binds himself
to the other party, the client, to carry out specific tasks for a specific price. (Bw. 1604v.)
Article 1601c. If an agreement contains the features of a labor agreement and of any other kind of
agreement, then the provisions regarding a labor agreement as well as those relevant to another kind of
agreement, which also have the same features, shall apply; in the event of a dispute regarding these
provisions, those relating to the labor agreement shall apply. If a contract for work is followed by more
similar agreements, whether directly or otherwise, or if, upon the conclusion or execution of the contract
for work, it appears that the intention of the parties is to conclude more such similar agreements in such
manner that the various contracts shall be regarded as a joint labor agreement, then the stipulations
regarding the labor agreement shall be applicable to these agreements on a joint and several basis, with
the exception of the stipulations of the sixth section of this title. If, however, in such case, the first
agreement has been concluded for test purposes only, it shall be deemed to have retained its nature as
a contract for work and the stipulations of the sixth section shall then apply to it. (Bw.1603x, 1604v.)
Section 2
Concerning labor agreements in general
Article 1601d. In the event that a labor agreement is concluded in writing, the costs of the deed and
other additional costs shall be borne by the employer. (Bw. 1466, 1601y)

Article 1601e. If, upon concluding the agreement, a deposit has been provided and accepted, it shall not
authorize the parties to cancel the agreement by ordering the retention or return of the deposit. The
deposit may only be deducted from the wage, if the services have not been rendered for longer than
three months, whereas the agreement has been entered into for a longer or unspecified time period.
Article 1601f. With regard to labor agreements concluded by a married woman as a laborer, the law
shall presume that she has obtained the approval of her husband. She can, therefore, commit all acts in
relation to these agreements, to grant a discharge and to appear in court, without the assistance of her
husband. She shall be entitled to use whatever she has received or claimed pursuant to the executed
labor agreement, for the benefit of her family. (Bw. 108v., 111, 1916; F.20-2)
Article 1601g. A minor shall be competent to conclude a labor agreement as a laborer, if he has been
given either verbal or written authorization to do so by his legal representative. A verbal authorization
can only apply to the conclusion of a certain labor agreement. If the minor has not reached the age of
eighteen years, then the authorization shall be granted in the presence of the employer, or of the
individual who acts on his behalf. The authorization cannot be conditional. If the authorization is issued
in writing, the minor must submit the authorization to the employer, who shall immediately issue a
certified copy to the minor and shall return the authorization to the minor or to the individual who is
entitled to it upon termination of the labor agreement. To the extent that the authorization is not subject
to certain specific stipulations, the minor in the performance of anything that is related to the labor
agreement entered into by him pursuant to the authorization issued, shall be equal to an adult, without
prejudice to the provision in the third paragraph of article 1602f. However, he cannot appear in court

representative is incapable of expressing himself. (Bw. 1446, 1603m; Rv.944)
Article 1601h. If an incompetent minor has concluded a labor agreement and as a result thereof, without

labor agreement. (Bw. 1446, 1454, 1916; S.26-335,article V, pg.603)
Article 1601i. A labor agreement concluded between two spouses shall be void. (Bw. 106v., 1467, 1678)
Article 1601j. (S.39-546; 47-208) A regulation stipulated by the employer shall only bind the laborer if he
has declared in writing that he agrees with such regulation and if the following is complied with:
(Bw.1601m, 1601x)
1. that a complete copy of the regulation shall be furnished to the laborer free of charge by or on behalf
of the employer;
2. that a signed complete copy of the regulation has been submitted by or on behalf of the employer to
the Department of social affairs (Afdeling Arbeid van het Departtement van sociale Zaken) for the
public's review;
3. that a complete copy of the regulations shall be displayed at a location that is accessible by the
laborer, preferably in the workplace, where it shall be visible and legible. The submission and the review
of the regulations at the Department of social affairs shall be free of charge. Each interested party may
obtain a free copy of the regulations from the Department of social affairs. Each stipulation, which
violates any provision of this article shall be void. (AB. 23; Bw. 1320-1, 1601y; K.402, 428)
Article 1601k. If, during the service relationship, a regulation shall be stipulated or an existing one shall
be amended, the new regulation or the amended one shall bind the laborer only if a complete copy of
the draft or of the proposed amendments has been submitted to him for his review, prior to the
confirmation thereof during such a time period and without any charge, so that he may be properly
advised of the contents. If the laborer, following the stipulation of the new or the amended regulation,
does not agree, then within a period of four weeks after he has become aware of the stipulation, he may
request the termination of the labor agreement from the judge. The judge shall decide after the hearing
or proper summons of the opposing party in the highest instance and shall approve the request, unless
he is of the opinion that the laborer's interest shall not or shall not to a serious extent be disadvantaged
as a result of the new or amended regulation. Pending the decision of the judge and upon denial of the
request, the service contract shall continue and the new or amended regulation *424 shall apply as of
the day on which it was effected. If the request is granted, the judge shall decide when the service
contract shall terminate and the laborer shall be entitled to compensation as stipulated in article 1603q
which relates to termination by the employer. Each stipulation which violates any provision of this article
shall be void. (AB.23; Bw.1603h and i; K.402, 428)

Article 1601l. A statement from a laborer, in which he covenants to agree with any regulation to be
stipulated in future or any future amendment to an existing regulation shall be void. (AB.23; K.402,428)
Article 1601m. The stipulations of the regulation can only be deviated from by specific written
agreement. (Bw. 1601d; K.402, 428)
Article 1601n. Each stipulation between the employer and the laborer, which violates a collective labor
agreement to which they are both bound, shall be declared void if a claim has been filed by any party to
the collective labor agreement, with the exception of the employer himself. A collective labor agreement
shall be interpreted as a an arrangement, drawn up by one or more employers or one or more
associations of employers which form legal entities, with one or more associations of laborers which
form legal entities, concerning labor conditions, which must be taken into account at the time the labor
agreements are concluded. (RO.116g)
Article 1601o. In calculating the daily wage for the purpose of this title, a day shall consist of ten hours, a
week of six days, a month of twenty five days and a year of three hundred days. In the event that the
wage, either in its entirety or partially, shall be determined in a manner other than in terms of time, then
the daily wage shall be computed according to the average wage of the laborer, computed over the last
thirty working days; in the absence of this criteria, the wage shall be determined as the customary wage
for the labor that is most similar in nature, location and time. (Bw. 1603q)
Article 1601p. The wage of laborers, who are not given lodgings by the employer, shall not be stipulated
otherwise than in terms of the following:
1. monetary;
2. food for consumption including food supplements, lighting and fuel supplies for use at the location
where they are distributed;
3. clothing, to be worn by the laborers in the performance of their services;
4. a specific amount of the products of the company, from which the wage is earned, or the basic or
supplementary material used by that company, to the extent that the nature and amount of the products
or basic or supplementary material form the basic necessities of life for the *425 laborer and his family,
or are used by the company which employs the laborer, as basic or supplementary material, implements
or tools, but in no circumstances shall it include alcoholic drinks and opium;
5. the use of a specific piece of land or pasture or stables for a stipulated number of animals according
to kind, belonging to the laborer or one of the members of his family, the use of work tools or equipment,
including the maintenance thereof;
6. specific labor or services, by or on behalf of the employer performed for the laborer;
7. the use of a designated residence or part thereof, free medical treatment for the laborer and his
family, free use of one or more servants, of an automobile or other means of transportation or of one or
more horses and other such similar allowances which reduce the expenses of the household, to the
extent that it is not yet included in the previous provisions;
8. a stipend during a period of leave after a specific number of years of service, or the entitlement to free
transportation to the place of origin or to and from the place where leave shall be taken. (Bw. 1601r;
K.429)
Article 1601q. In the event that no specific wage has been stipulated pursuant to an agreement or
regulation, the laborer shall be entitled to such wage that at the time the agreement was concluded,
would customarily have been stipulated for a similar job at the location where it is performed. If no such
custom exists, the wage shall be reasonably determined by taking into account the circumstances.
(K.402)
Article 1601r. To the extent that a wage, other than that permitted in article 1601 p, is stipulated, the
amount shall be evaluated in monetary terms and shall be deemed to be stipulated as five times the
amount. The entire wage due shall, however, not exceed more than one third of the wage determined in

accordance with the provisions of the previous article. Any stipulation which violates any provision of this
article shall be void. (AB.23; Bw.1602i; K.429)
Article 1601s. Each agreement between the employer or one of his officials or supervisors and one of
the laborers who is under their supervision shall be prohibited and void, if it provides that the laborer
shall be obliged to spend his wage or other income or part thereof in a specific manner, or to obtain his
necessaries from a specific place or from a specific individual. (AB.23; Bw. 1601 p and t) This provision
shall not apply to a stipulation which provides for participation by the laborer in a fund, provided that the
fund complies with the conditions stipulated by ordinance. (Bw. 1602r, paragraph 1 sub 3; S.26-377*)
*426 Article 1601t. If the laborer, notwithstanding a prohibited and void stipulation as mentioned in the
previous article, has concluded an agreement with the employer, no contract shall result therefrom. The
laborer shall be entitled to reclaim the money that was deducted from his wage and the costs incurred in
concluding the agreement, without being bound to return that which has been given to him to fulfill the
agreement. The judge shall however be authorized, pursuant to admittance of the laborer's claim, to
limit the judgment to such amount as would appear fair having regard to the circumstances, but shall
grant the amount, which, according to his evaluation, is the amount in respect of the loss suffered by the
laborer. If the laborer, despite a prohibited and void stipulation, as aforementioned, concludes an
agreement with a person other than the employer, he shall be entitled to claim the amount that he has
paid pursuant to such agreement or whatever remains owing and may be claimed from the employer.
The provisions of the second paragraph shall also apply to this. Each laborer's right to claim pursuant to
this article shall lapse after a period of six months. (Bw. 1602j, par.3, 1603t)
Article 1601u. The employer shall impose a fine in the event of violation of the conditions of an
agreement concluded in writing or of a regulation, if the conditions are stipulated and the fine is specified
in the agreement or the regulation. (Bw. 1601j) The agreement or the regulation, in which the fine is
stipulated, shall clearly specify the purpose of the fine. They shall not, either directly or indirectly
personally benefit the employer or the individual who has been authorized to impose the fine on the
laborers. Each fine, stipulated in a regulation or agreement, shall be specified in a specific amount, in
the currency that is used for the wage. (Bw. 1602h) The total amount of fines imposed on the laborer
within a week, shall never be higher than the amount of his daily wage. No fine imposed shall be higher
than this amount. (Bw. 1601e, 1601o) Each stipulation which violates any provision of this article shall
be void. However, deviations from the second, third, fourth paragraphs shall be permitted in agreements
concluded in writing or in a regulation but only with regard to laborers who earn more then eight guilders
per day. If this occurs, then the judge shall be authorized to stipulate a smaller fine if the aforementioned
amount appears unreasonable to him. (AB.23; Bw.1309) The stipulation in respect of punishment by the
employer, as mentioned in the tenth section of the first chapter of this Book shall apply to the stipulation
and the specification of fines within the meaning of this article. (Bw.1306, 1601x, 1602r, first paragraph
sub 2; K.410)
Article 1601v. The employer shall not be permitted to impose fines and claim compensation at the same
time in relation to the same matter. (Bw. 1307) *427 Each stipulation which violates this provision shall
be void. (AB.23)
Article 1601w. If one of the parties intentionally or due to his actions breaches one of his obligations and
the damage suffered by the opposition as a result thereof cannot be evaluated in terms of money, the
judge shall, in a fair manner, stipulate a sum of money as compensation. (Bw. 1241)
Article 1601x. An agreement between the employer and the laborer, which restricts the latter-mentioned,
following the termination of his employment, in his capacity to be employed in a certain manner shall be
valid only if it has been agreed with an adult laborer in writing or in a regulation. (Bw. 1601j) The judge,
may, either based on a claim of the laborer or upon his defense in a dispute, nullify such an agreement
in its entirety or partially, on grounds that, the comparison between the interest of the employer to be
protected and that of the laborer shows that the laborer has been unfairly disadvantaged by such
agreement. With regard to the agreement mentioned in the first paragraph, the employer cannot assume
any rights, if he has terminated the employment unlawfully, or if the laborer intentionally or due to his
own fault has submitted an urgent reason to terminate the employment and has exercised this authority,
or if the judge at the request or pursuant to a claim by the laborer has declared the labor agreement to
be terminated based upon urgent reasons which were submitted by the laborer and caused intentionally
by or due to the actions of the employer. (Bw. 1603e, 1603n, 1603p) If the employer of the laborer has
negotiated compensation to apply in the event of a violation by the latter-mentioned of a provision as
mentioned in the first paragraph, the judge shall be authorized to reduce the compensation to a smaller
sum, if the agreed sum appears to be excessive. (Bw. 1309, 1611u; K. 404)

Article 1601y. Revoked: S.28-533 see also 29-261, currently article VI C, pg.603.
Section 3
Concerning the obligations of employers
Article 1602. An employer is obligated to pay the wage of the laborer at a stipulated time. (Bw. 1601 o-r
p-2 sub 3; F.232)
Article 1602a. The wage payable in respect of a certain period of time is due from the date upon which
the laborer is employed until the termination of his employment. (Bw. 1601 o).
Article 1602b. No wage shall be due in respect of a period during which the laborer has not performed
the agreed labor.
Article 1602c. However, the laborer shall be entitled to the wage stipulated to be payable in respect of a
certain period of time, for a relatively short time period, if, as a result of illness or accident, he is
prevented from performing his tasks, unless the illness or accident has been caused intentionally or as a
result of his misconduct, or is the result of a physical handicap in respect of which he has deliberately
submitted false information to the employer upon concluding the agreement. (Bw.1244v.) (S.39-256,
292) If, however, he receives monetary compensation or benefits in such case as a result of legal
regulations regarding illness or accidents, or pursuant to insurance or from certain funds, in which
participation is mandatory, or which result from the labor agreement, then the wage shall be reduced by
the amount of the compensation or benefit. (Bw. 1601 s; S.39-255*, 256*, 693*) The laborer shall also
retain his rights to the wage payable in respect of a certain period of time for a shorter time period
computed in a fair manner, if he, without monetary compensation, either in compliance with an
obligation imposed by law or authority which could not have been fulfilled outside his hours of work, or
as a result of very special circumstances beyond his control, was prevented from performing his tasks.
(Bw. 1602 u) The following shall be interpreted as very special circumstances for the purpose of this
article: the delivery of a child by the spouse of the laborer, the demise and funeral of one of his coinhabitants or one of his kin or relatives by marriage unlimited in the direct line and in the second degree
of the collateral line. The exercise of the voting right shall also be interpreted as compliance with an
obligation imposed by the law or authority. (Bw. 290v.) In the event that the monetary wage is stipulated
in a *429 manner other than in respect of a certain period of time, the provisions of this article shall also
apply, provided that the wage shall be deemed to be the customary wage which the laborer would have
earned during that time if he had not been prevented from doing so. The wage, however, shall be
reduced by the amount of the expenses which the laborer has saved by not performing the labor. The
provisions of this article may only be deviated from by written agreement or regulation. (Bw. 1601j;
K.412, 416h)
Article 1602d. The laborer shall not lose his right in respect of a wage agreed in respect of a certain
period of time, if he has been willing to perform the agreed tasks, but the employer has not made use of
this, either due to his fault or due to an incidental obstruction to him personally. The provisions of the
second, fifth, sixth and seventh paragraphs of the aforementioned article are applicable hereto.
Article 1602e. If the wage consists entirely or partially of an amount that is dependent on information
which should have been apparent from the employer's bookkeeping, then the laborer shall be entitled to
request information, regarding the evidence which would be required to know the amount of his wage,
from the employer. It may be stipulated by written agreement or regulation that notification of the
aforementioned evidence, instead of being submitted to each laborer separately, shall be submitted to a
stipulated number of laborers in the service of the employer or to one or more experts in the
bookkeeping section which shall be selected by the laborers in writing. The notification of evidence by or
on behalf of the employer shall be given in confidence, if such is expressly requested by the laborer and
the individual with whom he is replaced in accordance with the previous paragraph; the lattermentioned, however, can never be bound to the laborer to observe confidentiality. The requirement for
secrecy shall be abolished insofar as is necessary, if this matter is disputed in court. (Supplemented
with S.31-367 see also 368) To the extent that the information, referred to in the first paragraph,
concerns the profit gained by the employer's undertaking or part thereof, the provisions of the first
paragraph, either stipulated in a written agreement or regulation, may be deviated from which may be in
a manner other than that described in the second paragraph, provided that, having regard to the
provisions of the second paragraph, the laborer shall always be given an explicit and clear notification,
which describes the computation of the amount referred to in the first paragraph. (supplemented with
S.31-368) Without prejudice to the application of the fourth paragraph, the notification as mentioned in

the previous paragraph shall occur, if so desired, pursuant to express requirement for confidentiality by
the laborer as described in the third paragraph. (Bw.1601j, 1602n; Sw.323)
*430 Article 1602f. In order to pay the wage owed to the laborer, the authorization referred to in the first
paragraph of article 1385 shall be in writing. If it is stipulated in the written authorization, as mentioned in
article 1601 g, that the wage in the form of money shall entirely or partially be given to the legal
representative, instead of being handed to the minor, then he shall, with respect to the payment of the
wage, or the part thereof which is due him, be regarded as the laborer. Notwithstanding that no such
condition has been included in written authorization, or even in the verbal authorization, the monetary
wage due to the minor shall be given to the legal representative, if he opposes in writing, the payment of
the wage to the minor. In circumstances other than those mentioned in the second and third paragraph
of this article, the employer shall be released from his obligation to make payment of the wage directly to
the minor. (Amended by S.38-622) Payment to third parties, in violation of the provisions of this or the
next article, shall be void.
Article 1602g. Seizure by the employer of the wage owed to the laborer, if the monetary wage is in the
amount of eight guilders per day or less, shall not apply to more than one fifth of the monetary wage. If
the monetary wage is more than eight guilders a day, the seizure shall continue to apply only to one fifth
of the wage, and shall thereafter be unlimited upon further seizures. There shall be no restrictions if the
purpose of the seizure is to recoup support payment, to which the employer taking possession is entitled
according to the law. (Bw. 1601o; Rv. 451v., 749v.) Transfer, pawning, or any other act pursuant to
which the laborer assigns any right in respect of his wage to a third party, shall be valid only to the
extent that a seizure of his wage shall be valid. (Bw. 613, 1153) Authorization to claim a wage, in any
shape or form, issued by the laborer, may be revoked. (Bw. 1792v., 1814) Each agreement, which
violates any provision of this article, shall be void. (AB. 23; K.433, 446; F.20-2)
Article 1602h. The payment of a wage comprising money shall be made in legal Indonesian currency,
provided that the wage stipulated in foreign currency shall be computed according to the rate on the
date and at place of payment, or in the event that no rate is obtainable in such location, it shall be in
accordance with that at the nearest business location where a rate is obtainable. (LN. 53-40 article 8*
pg.392; K.433, 445) Exceptions may be made to the provision in the first paragraph for specific regions
or part of regions by ordinance.
Article 1602j. Payment of the wage in a manner other than that stipulated in the previous two articles,
shall be void. The laborer shall continue to be entitled to claim the wage due to him from the employer,
without being obliged to return to him that which was received by virtue *431 of the payment which has
been nullified. The judge shall however, be authorized, pursuant to the granting the laborers' claim, to
restrict the penalty to such an amount that he deems fair in view of the circumstances, but ultimately to
the amount that in his opinion was the amount of loss suffered by the laborer. Each laborer's right to
claim pursuant to this article shall lapse after a period of six months. (Bw. 1601 t, paragraph 4; 1603 t)
Article 1602k. If the location of payment of the wage is not stipulated in the agreement or regulation or
by custom, then payment shall occur at the option of the employer, either at the location where the tasks
are usually performed, or at the office of the employer if this is located at the place where the majority of
the laborers reside, or at the residence of the laborer. (Bw. 1393)
Article 1602l. The payment of the wage stipulated to be in respect of a certain period of time shall occur
as follows: (Bw.16020; K.452d) if the wage is stipulated for a week or shorter period of time, after each
week; if the wage is stipulated to be in respect of a period of time which is longer than one week, but
shorter than one month, after the lapse of the period in respect of which the wage is stipulated to be
payable; if the wage is stipulated on a monthly basis, after every month; if the wage is stipulated to be in
respect of a longer period of time than one month, after every quarter. This arrangement may only be
deviated from to such extent, that in an agreement concluded in writing or regulation, the payment shall
be stipulated to be of a wage in respect of a shorter period of time than one half of a month, after each
half of a month, and of a wage that has been stipulated on a monthly basis, after each quarter. The
payment of the wage of laborers who live with the employer, shall, in deviating to a certain extent from
the above-mentioned provisions, take place every time after the lapse of the period of time, as indicated
by local custom, unless it has been stipulated by written agreement or regulation that the payment shall
occur pursuant to the provisions of the first paragraph. (AB.15; Bw. 1601j) The periods of payment,
under or pursuant to this article, may always be expedited by the parties upon mutual agreement.
Article 1602m. The payment of the wage stipulated in the form of money but not in respect of a certain
period of time, shall take place having regard to the provisions of the previous article, provided that this
wage shall be deemed to have been stipulated in respect of a period of time for which the wage would

usually be stipulated for labor which is the most comparable to the labor for which the wage is owed, in
terms of nature, location and time. (Bw. 1601 q; K. 452 d)
Article 1602n. To the extent that the wage stipulated in the form of money comprises an amount, that is
dependent *432 upon information which is apparent from the employer's books, payment shall take
place every time that the amount of the wage can be determined, provided that the payment shall occur
at least once a year. To the extent that the information referred to in the first paragraph concerns the
profit gained by the employer's undertaking or part thereof, and the nature of the enterprise or the
custom results in the profit being stipulated after the lapse of more than one year, it can be agreed by
written agreement or regulation, that the payment shall be made after every stipulation. (Bw. 1601j,
1602e)
Article 1602o. If the monetary wage is stipulated in part to be in respect of a period of time, and in part in
another manner, or if the parts of the wage have been stipulated to be in respect of different periods of
time, then the provisions of article 1602 l through 1602 n shall apply to each part.
Article 1602p. Each payment shall be of the entire amount of the wage due. However, with respect to
the wage which is stipulated in the form of money, but dependent on the result of the task to be
performed, it may be agreed by written agreement or regulation, that every time, should the possibility
arise, without prejudice to the definite computation upon the first payment date, a specific part of the
wage shall be paid, which shall comprise at least three fourths of the customary wage for labor which is
most comparable in terms of nature, location and time. (Bw. 1390; K. 444)
Article 1602q. To the extent that the wage stipulated in the form of money, or the portion thereof that
remains after deduction of that which the employer is not obliged to pay, and after deduction of that to
which third parties, in accordance with the provisions of this title, shall apply their rights, shall not be
paid later than after the third working day after such date, on which the payment should have occurred
pursuant to articles 1602l, 1602m and 1602o, then, if this failure to pay is caused by the employer, the
laborer shall be entitled to an increase due to the delay, which from the fourth until the eight working day
shall amount to five hundredth (5%) a day and for each working day thereafter shall amount to one
hundredth (1%), provided that the increase arising due to delay shall in no circumstances exceed one
half of the amount owing. The judge shall, however, be authorized to restrict the increase to such
amount as he deems appropriate having regard to the circumstances. (K.430, 452c.) An agreement,
which deviates from a specific provision of this article, shall apply only to laborers whose wages
stipulated in money amount to more than eight guilders a day. (AB.23; Bw.1250)
Article 1602r. In addition to the termination of the service relationship, the claim for payment of the
wages due may only be compared with the following debts of the laborers: (Bw. 1425v., 1968v.) *433 1.
compensation for the damage caused by the laborer to the employer; (Bw. 1601 x) 2. the fines payable
to the employer pursuant to article 1601 u, provided he submits written evidence, specifying the amount
of each fine, including the time when and the reason for which it was imposed, stipulating the provision
of the regulation or the written agreement which has been breached; 3. the contribution to a fund by the
employer in accordance with the second paragraph of article 1601 s deposited on behalf of the laborer;
4. the rent in respect of a residence, a space, a piece of land or of implements or tools, used by the
laborer in his own business, and leased by the employer to the laborer pursuant to a written agreement;
(Bw. 1560-2, 1601 p sub 5) 5. the sale price of regular and common necessities of the household,
excluding alcoholic drinks and opium, as well as that of basic or supplementary material used by the
laborer in his own business, which shall be delivered by the employer to the laborer, provided such
delivery is evidenced by a written declaration submitted by the laborer, in which the cause and the
amount of the debt are stipulated, and provided that the employer shall not seek more than the actual
cost, and that that amount shall not be higher than that which the laborer can pay elsewhere for the
necessities of the household, basic or supplementary material. (Bw. 1601 p sub 4) 6. the amount of
wages paid in advance, by the employer to the laborer in the form of money, provided it is apparent from
a statement as mentioned in the previous number; 7. the amount of overpayment of wages; (Bw.1359)
8. the charges for medical care and treatment, which shall be made pursuant to article 1602x, borne by
the laborer. With respect to that which the employer may claim pursuant to numbers 2, 3 and 5, he may
not compare more than one fifth of the fixed wage stipulated in the form of money with each payment of
the wage, which should have been paid in that case; with respect to what he may claim in its entirety
pursuant to the provisions of this article, the debt comparison shall not extend further than two fifth parts
of the same amount. Any agreement, which would extend the employer's authority to compare the
debts, shall be void. (AB.23)
Article 1602s. If the entire wage or part thereof of the laborer is stipulated in the form of lodging, board
or other necessities of life, the employer shall be obligated to fulfill this, provided that they are in
accordance with the requirements of health and proper conduct, pursuant to local custom. Any

agreement, which excludes or restricts the obligations of the employer, shall be void. (AB.15, 23;
Bw.1601p sub 2 and 3, 1603p-2 par. sub 4)
Article 1602t. An employer, who is temporarily prevented from paying the portion of a wage that is
applied to lodging, board or other necessities of life, if the prevention is not as a result of his own
actions, shall owe *434 the laborer compensation, the amount of which shall be stipulated by agreement
or, in the absence of such, by local custom. (AB.15; Bw. 1239)
Article 1602u. The employer shall be obligated to afford the opportunity to the live-in laborers, without
making deductions from their wages, to fulfill their religious obligations, and to enjoy rest from their
labors, in both cases in the manner stipulated by agreement, or in the absence of such, as regulated by
local custom. (AB.15; Bw.1602 c)
Article 1602v. (Amended by S.36-481 see also 38-137) The employer must organize the labor in such
manner, that the laborer shall not be obliged to perform any labor on Sundays and on the days, which
according to local custom in respect of the stipulated tasks are regarded as Sundays. (K. 441)
Pursuant to S.36-481 see also 38-137, dated July 1, 1938 the following new paragraphs 2-5 have been
inserted, pursuant to S.47-208 paragraph 3 has been amended:
If the nature of the labor is such that, the employer is entitled to deviate from the stipulation in the
previous paragraph, provided that at least two free Sundays shall be provided in a month and the
number of holidays a year shall be not less than 52. If, in connection with the specific requirements of
certain enterprises, it cannot be reasonably expected that in such enterprises or in specific departments
or periods of those enterprises at least two free Sundays shall be provided a month, then, with prior
approval of the Department of social affairs, a regulation deviating from the previous paragraph may be
stipulated in respect of the laborers or group of laborers in those enterprises, provided that the number
of holidays a year shall be 52. Rules may be stipulated pursuant to government ordinance for the
issuance of the aforementioned approval. (S.37-27 see also 38-137* below) If an act has been
committed which violates the stipulations in the first or second paragraph as well as against a deviating
arrangement as mentioned in the third paragraph, the laborer shall, upon deviating from that which is
stipulated in article 1601 w, in respect of each free Sunday or any other holiday not enjoyed, be entitled
to compensation in the amount of twice the daily wage stipulated in terms of money. Each right to file a
claim pursuant to this article, shall lapse after three years, effective as of the last day of the calendar
year in which an insufficient number of free Sundays or other holidays have been provided. With respect
to minor laborers, the employer must regulate the labor in such manner which, according to local
custom, provides them with the opportunity to follow advanced or repeat classes in religion or to learn a
trade. Any agreement which violates this stipulation shall be void. (AB.15,23) (Supplemented S.31-367
see also 368) Pursuant to government ordinance, rules may be stipulated obliging the *435 employer if
deemed necessary to record the holidays taken in designated registers.
Pursuant to S.33-72 and 268 regulations regarding registers of holidays in pharmacies, warehouse
enterprises and shipyards were stipulated, which were revoked pursuant to S.38-366. See LN 54-37
Regulations regarding annual leave pertaining to laborers (Peraturan Istirahat Tahunan bagi buruh).
Pursuant to S.37-27 see also 38-138, dated July 1, 1938 the following is stipulated:

deviating regulation, as mentioned in the third paragraph of article 1602 v of the Civil Code, shall be
requested on stamped paper addressed to the Minister, that shall be filed with the inspector of the labor
inspection board of the area, in which the enterprise of the party making the request is located. The

holidays a year, shall be complied with, 2. that there is no stipulation that the regulation shall apply no
longer than a term stipulated therein, which shall not exceed a duration of one year. (2) (Amended by
S.48-81) Upon expiration of the term referred to in the previous paragraph, the regulation shall no longer
be valid and a new regulation, duly approved by the Director of Social Affairs shall be stipulated. (3) The
approval for the stipulation of a new regulation may be denied, if it appears that the regulation which
was previously applicable, has not been fully complied with. 3. Upon the filing of a request as mentioned
in article 1, the decision shall be issued in writing, a copy of which shall be forwarded to the party

making the request. 4. (1) The manager of an enterprise, to which approval has been issued for the
stipulation of a deviating regulation as mentioned in article 1 and in respect of which the registration of
holidays has not already been legally prescribed for other reasons, shall be obligated to ensure that the
holidays enjoyed by each laborer employed by such enterprise shall be recorded in a register at the
offices of the enterprise, which shall be arranged in accordance with the model described in the
government ordinance. (New model: S.40-246) (2) (Supplemented by S.38-206) If the approval for the

be an individual whose labor agreement is subject to the stipulations of the seventh chapter A of the
third book of the Civil Code. (4) The manager shall be obligated within 5 days after the last day of each
month to affix his signature to the recordings referred to in paragraph (1). (5) The register as mentioned

an incorrect entry in the register pertaining to holidays enjoyed by a laborer, shall be punishable by
imprisonment for a maximum of two months or a monetary fine subject to a maximum of five hundred
guilders. A second or subsequent violation, within two years after the last conviction has become
irrevocable, may result in imprisonment for a maximum term of three months. (2) A separate punishment
shall be imposed for each violation with regard to each laborer who has violated the provisions of article
4 para. (1) and par. (4), without prejudice to the observance of article 70 par. (2) of the Penal Code. (3)
The individuals responsible for discovering the actions punishable under this article shall be the officials
of the labor inspection, in addition to the officials who are assigned to the discovery of punishable acts in
general.
Article 1602w. The employer shall be obligated to design and maintain the rooms, implements and tools,
in which or with which the laborer shall perform the tasks, and also to stipulate such regulations and to
issue such instructions regarding the performance of the tasks, in such manner that the laborer shall be
protected against endangerment to himself, his honor and property, insofar as is reasonable in
connection with the nature of the labor. In the event that those obligations are not complied with, the
employer shall be liable to the laborer for damages, as a result of performing his tasks in the course of
his duty, unless he can provide evidence that the failure to comply has been caused by force majeure,
or that the damage to a significant extent can be imputed to the laborer's blatant actions. (Bw. 1245v.) If
the laborer, as a result of the employer's failure to comply with his obligations, in the performance of his
service, severely injures himself which injury results in death, the employer shall be obliged to
compensate the surviving spouse and the children or parents of the deceased who were supported by
his labor, unless he can provide proof that the death was caused by force majeure, or due to the
laborer's fault. (Bw. 1245, 1370). Any agreement, which restricts or excludes the obligations of the
employer, shall be void. (AB.23) However, some regulations may be stipulated pursuant to an
ordinance, which transfer the employer's obligation regarding compensation as mentioned in the second
and third *437 paragraph, to other parties.
Article 1602x. The employer must, in case of illness or accident of a laborer who lives with him and who
has been in his service for a period of not less than six weeks, provide him with proper nursing and
medical treatment, to the extent that this has not been provided otherwise. He shall be entitled to charge
the laborer with the costs in respect of the first four weeks only, if the illness or accident was caused
deliberately or due to his immorality or is the result of a physical handicap, regarding which, the laborer
deliberately misinformed him upon entering into the agreement. Any agreement which excludes or
restricts the obligations of the employer shall be void. (AB.23; Bw.1602r 1 sub 8, 1602s, 1603c; K.412,
416h)

Article 1602z. The employer must, at the termination of the service relations, upon the request of the
laborer, furnish him with a dated and signed letter of recommendation. The letter of recommendation
shall contain an accurate description of the nature of the tasks performed and the duration of service, as
well as but only at the specific request of the individual to whom the letter of recommendation shall be
issued, details of the manner in which the laborer has fulfilled his obligations and the manner in which
the relationship of employment was terminated; however, if the employer terminated the relationship
without providing any reasons therefor, he shall be obligated only to make a statement to such effect,
and shall not be obligated to notify the reasons as such; if the laborer terminated the relationship of
employment unlawfully, then the employer shall be entitled to specify such in the letter of
recommendation. (Bw. 1603n) The employer, who refuses to provide the requested letter of
recommendation, who includes inaccurate information in the letter of recommendation against his better
judgment or who inserts a mark into the letter of recommendation for the purpose of providing

information regarding the laborer which is not included in the text of the letter of recommendation, or
who provides information to third parties which directly conflicts with the recommendation letter, shall be
liable for the damage resulting therefrom with regard to the laborer as well as to third parties. (Bw. 1239)

agreement, shall be terminated
Article 1603e. The relationship of employment shall terminate by law, if the time period expires pursuant
to an agreement or regulation, or by legal requirement, or in the absence thereof, as determined by
custom. Advance notice, shall in such event be required in the following circumstances only: 1. if such is
agreed upon by written agreement or by regulation; 2. if, by legal requirement or according to custom,
even in respect of a previously stipulated time period, a notice shall be given, and the parties shall not,
had they been permitted, deviate from such by written agreement or regulation. (AB.15; Bw.1339,
1601jv., 1603q, 1603u; K.433, 448v)
Article 1603f. (As amended by S.39-546) If the relationship of employment, following the lapse of time
as described in the first paragraph of the previous article, is continued by the parties without any
objection, then it shall be deemed that the agreement was concluded for the same time period, subject
to it being for not more than one year, and subject to the same conditions. If the relationship of
employment is extended for less than six months, then it shall be deemed to be concluded for an
indefinite period, but subject to the same conditions. The same shall apply, if in the events stipulated in
the second paragraph of the previous article, the timely notice is not given. Pursuant to a written
agreement or by regulation, the consequences of an untimely notice may be regulated differently,
provided that the relationship of employment shall be extended for at least six months. (Bw.732, 1573,
1587, 1598, 1603 q)
Article 1603g. If the term of a relationship of employment has not been indicated by agreement,

Article 1603i. (Amended by S.39-546) Without prejudice to the stipulations in the following two
paragraphs of this article the period of notice shall be at least one month. The term in the previous
paragraph may be extended by written agreement or regulation with regard to the laborer for not more
than one month, if the relationship of employment, at the time of the notice, has lasted for at least two
continuous years. The term stipulated in the first paragraph shall be extended for the employer,
respectively for one month, two months or three months, if at the time of the notice the relationship of
employment has lasted respectively at least one year but less than two years, at least two years but less
than three years for a continuous period of time. Any agreement, which violates any provision of this
article, shall be void. (Bw.1601jv., 1603 ibis, 1603 iter; K. 433, 450; F.39)
Article 1603i bis. (Supplemented by S.39-546) A new labor agreement, concluded by a laborer with the
same employer for a definite time period of less than six months, within four weeks of the termination of
the previous relationship of employment, shall, regardless of whether the previous relationship of
employment was concluded for a definite or indefinite time period, be considered as an agreement
concluded for an indefinite time period. (Bw.1916, 1921)
Article 1603i ter. (Supplemented by S.39-546) Relationships of employment with the same employer,
which have been interrupted or were for a period of less than four weeks, or were directly following one

1575, 1603 k, 1612)
Article 1603k. The relationship of employment shall not be terminated by the death of the employer,

the laborer shall be authorized to terminate the relationship of employment entered into for a specific
time period, by giving notice pursuant to the provisions of article 1603 h and 1603 i, as if it was
concluded for an indefinite period of time. (Bw.1575, 1603j; K.433, 450; F.39)
Article 1603l. If a trial period is stipulated, then each of the parties shall be authorized, within such time
period, to give notice of termination of the relationship of employment. Any agreement, which stipulates

as well any agreement concluded between the parties for a new trial period, shall be void. (Bw. 1499)
Article 1603m. If the legal representative of a minor considers that the labor agreement concluded by

authorization in article 1601 g have not been complied with, he may request the judge at the location of
the actual residence of the minor in writing to declare the labor agreement to be dissolved. The judge
shall not grant the request until after the hearing or proper summons of the minor, and also of the
employer, and if the minor is under guardianship and such guardianship has been assigned to the
Orphan's Chamber, of the latter mentioned. If the judge grants the request, he shall then stipulate the
date on which the relationship of employment shall be terminated. No appeal shall be permitted to be
filed against the decision, without prejudice to the authority of the Attorney General at the Supreme
Court to, only on a point of law, appeal for cassation of the decision. (Bw. 366, 1603v; RO. 170)
Article 1603n. Each one of the parties may terminate the relationship of employment without any notice
or without having regard to the provisions applicable to termination; however, the party who effects such
without the other party's approval, is acting unlawfully, unless he compensates the other party at such
time as stipulated in article 1603 q, or terminates the relationship of employment for an urgent reason,
duly notifying the other party thereof. (Bw. 1603w; K.433, 451)
Article 1603o. With regard to the employer, within the meaning of the previously mentioned article, those
acts, traits or the behavior of the laborer, which shall result in the fact that the employer cannot be
reasonably expected to continue the relationship of employment, shall be regarded as urgent. (Bw.
1339, 1602y, 1603d, 1603v) Urgent reasons, inter alia, may be considered to exist as follows: 1. if the
laborer upon entering into the agreement has misled the employer by furnishing him with forged or
falsified letters of recommendation, or if he has deliberately misinformed the employer regarding the
manner in which his previous relationship of employment was terminated; (Bw. 1602 z) 2. if, the laborer,
does not possess any of the skills or expertise for the tasks to which he has bound himself; 3. if the
laborer, despite warnings, becomes inebriated, is guilty of abuse of opium or other debauchery; 4. If he
is guilty of theft, embezzlement, fraud or other misdemeanors, which render him unworthy of his
employer's trust; (Sw. 362, 372, 378) 5. if the laborer mistreats, grossly insults or seriously threatens the
employer, members of his family or household members or co-workers; (Bw. 1365 v.) *442 6. if the

laborer induces or attempts to induce the employer, members of his family or household members to
commit acts that are in violation of the law or proper morals; 7. if the laborer, deliberately or despite
warnings, recklessly damages or seriously endangers the employer's property; (Sw. 406) 8. if the
laborer deliberately or despite warnings, recklessly, exposes himself or others to serious danger; 9. if
the laborer discloses any particulars regarding the employer's household which he should have kept
confidential; (Sw. 322) 10. if the laborer persistently refuses to comply with reasonable orders or
instructions issued to him by or on behalf of the employer; (Bw.1603b) 11. if the laborer in some other
manner grossly neglects the duties assigned to him pursuant to the agreement; 12. if the laborer, as a
result of intentional or reckless actions, becomes incapable of performing the stipulated tasks.(K.411,
418) Agreements, which permit the decision to be made by the employer in the event of an urgent
reason within the meaning of article 1603n, shall be void. (AB.23)
Article 1603p. In respect of the laborer, such circumstances which would render it impossible to
reasonably expect the laborer to continue the relationship of employment shall be regarded as urgent
reasons within the meaning of article 1603 n (Bw. 1339, 1602y, 1603d and v) Urgent reasons, may,
among others be deemed to exist in the following circumstances: 1. if the employer mistreats the
laborer, members of his family or household members, grossly humiliates or seriously threatens them,
or tolerates such treatment by the other household members or subordinates; (Bw.1365v.; Sw.310,
336,351) 2. if the employer induces or attempts to induce the laborer, members of his family or
household members, to commit acts in violation of the law or proper morals, or tolerates such
inducement or attempted inducement by one of the members of his household or subordinates;
(Sw.293v.) 3. if the employer cannot pay the wage at a specific time; (Bw. 1602) 4. if the employer, in
the event that board and lodging are included in the labor agreement, does not provide such in a proper
manner; (Bw.1602t) 5. if the employer does not provide the laborer with sufficient labor, in the event that
the laborer's wage is dependent on the amount of labor performed; (Bw. 1602 p) 6. if the employer,
does not properly provide the agreed support to the laborer, whose wage is dependent on the labor
performed; 7. if the employer in some other manner grossly neglects the duties assigned to him
pursuant to the agreement; 8. if the employer instructs the laborer, despite his refusal, to perform labor
in the company of another employer, even though the nature of the relationship of employment does not
stipulate such. 9. if the continuation of the relationship of employment, *443 on the part of the laborer,
could involve serious endangerment to life, health, morals, or good name, and such was not evident at
the time that the agreement was concluded; 10. if the laborer due to illness or other causes due to no
fault of his shall become incapable of performing the agreed tasks. (S.39-545*; K.412, 419) Agreements,
which provide for the decision to be made by the laborer in the event of an urgent reason within the
meaning of article 1603n, shall be void. (AB.23)
Article 1603q. (Amended by S.31-367, 368; 39-546) The compensation for damage as mentioned in
articles 1601 k and 1603 n, shall, with regard to relationships of employment which are or are deemed to
have been concluded for an indefinite time period, be equal to the amount of the wage owing in respect
of the period until the first day following termination by termination notice; with regard to a relationship of
employment concluded for a specific time period, compensation shall be equal to the amount of the
wage for the duration that the service relationship, according to articles 1603 e and 1607 f, should have
existed. Wage, in this case shall be defined as parts of the wage, as mentioned in numbers 1 and 7 of
article 1601 p. If the wage of the laborer is not fully or partly stipulated according to a period of time,
then the rules of article 1601 o shall apply. Any agreement which stipulates a lower amount of
compensation for the laborer shall be void. (AB.23) A higher amount of compensation may be stipulated
pursuant to a written agreement or regulation. (Bw. 1601 d and j.) The judge shall be authorized to

his fault has provided the opposing party with an urgent reason to terminate the relationship *444 of
employment without any notice or without having regard to the stipulations applicable to the termination,
and the opposing party has exercised such authority. (Bw. 1239, 1603 n, o, p, t)

Article 1603s bis. (Supplemented by S.31-367 see also 368) If the employer terminates the relationship
of employment with the intention of releasing himself from the obligation to provide the laborer with an
agreed period of leave following a specific number of years of service, which was stipulated in or related
to the agreement, then the laborer shall be entitled to claim compensation for such period of leave in
addition to that which he is entitled to upon dismissal, which compensation he should have enjoyed
during his leave in accordance with the agreement, and if he was entitled to free transportation pursuant
to the agreement, the amount that would have been required for the trip to the place of origin or
destination of leave, at the time that the relationship of employment was terminated. (Bw. 1603 t; S.39545*) If, apart from the case mentioned in the previous article, half of the service period stipulated in the
agreement required for the extension of the leave, has lapsed, and the employer, unilaterally, without
providing any urgent reasons, terminates the agreement, he must, in addition to whatever he owes the
laborer, pay him a certain sum which is proportionate to the amount of compensation referred to in the
first paragraph as the proportion due at the time at which the agreement is terminated, after the term of
employment required for obtaining leave has passed and the term of employment required for obtaining
a leave. For the purpose of calculating the term of employment, the month in which the agreement ends
shall be regarded as full whole month. The same shall apply, if the laborer, after part of the service
period as mentioned in the previous paragraph has passed, terminates the relationship of employment
for urgent reasons provided by the employer, as well as if the judge declares the agreement to be
terminated, for significant, but not urgent reasons as mentioned in article 1603 v or as a result of an
urgent reason provided by the employer, or pursuant to article 1267, if the employer does not fulfill his
obligations. If the judge declares the agreement to be terminated for a reason other than an urgent
reason, he shall be authorized to reduce the amount of money as stipulated in the second paragraph to
such sum that he shall deem fair having regard to the circumstances.

the duration of the life of a specific individual, the laborer shall nevertheless be authorized to terminate
at the time that five years have elapsed after the agreement was concluded, by giving a termination
notice of six months. *445 Any agreement, which excludes or restricts this authority to terminate, shall
be void. (AB.23; Bw. 1603 e, h; K. 433, 449)
Article 1603v. Each one of the parties shall at all times, even prior to commencement of the labor, be
authorized to submit a written request to the residential judge at the location of his actual residence, to
have the labor agreement declared terminated. Any agreement which excludes or restricts this authority
for termination shall be void. (Bw. 1603 s bis; S. 39-545*) That which shall be regarded as significant
reasons shall be, in addition to urgent reasons as mentioned in article 1603 n, changes in the personal
or financial status of the applicant or opposing party or in the circumstances in which the tasks shall be
performed, which are of such nature that the service relationship shall, in order to ensure equitable
treatment, be terminated immediately or after a short period of time. The judge shall not grant the
request until after a hearing or proper summons of the opposing party. The last two paragraphs of article
1603 m are applicable hereto.(K.412, 420)

Article 1916. Legal inferences are those which, pursuant to a special legal stipulation, are related to
certain acts or events. Legal inferences are, among others: (K.75, 539)
1. the acts which are declared invalid by law, due to the fact that, pursuant to their nature and capacity,
they are alleged to have been committed in order to evade a legal regulation; (Bw.183v., 911, 1681) 2.
the events in which the law declares that the property, or the discharge of a debt, are deduced from
certain specific circumstances; (Bw.159, 165, 633, 658v., 662, 664, 831, 1394, 1439, 1769) 3. the
authority which the law grants to a legal judgment entered; (Bw.1917v.) 4. the validity which the law

Civ. 1350)
Article 1917. The authority of the legal judgment entered shall not extend any further than the subject of
the judgment. In order to invoke such authority, it shall be required that the case which has been heard
shall be the same; that the claim is based upon the same grounds, and is made by and against the
same parties having the same relationship. (Bw. 1340, 1409, 1858, 1862; Rv.83, 385,428,436; Civ.

other evidence. No evidence shall be admitted against a valid inference, in the event that the law, based
upon such inference, shall declare certain acts to be invalid or refuse to permit a claim to be filed in
court; unless the law permits the counter evidence to be filed, without prejudice to what has been
stipulated concerning the legal oath and legal testimony. (Bw.150, 250v., 1394, 1439, 1916-1, 1923,
1929; F.41, 44; Aut.4; Octr.6; Industr.2; Coop.10; Civ.1352)
Article 1922. Inferences which are not based upon the law, shall be considered by and shall be at the
discretion of the judge, who, shall only pay attention to those which are significant, accurate, specific,
