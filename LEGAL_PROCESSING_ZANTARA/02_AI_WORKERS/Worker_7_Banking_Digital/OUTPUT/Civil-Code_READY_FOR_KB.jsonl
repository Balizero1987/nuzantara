He may deny the legitimacy of a child, who is born more than three hundred days after the\njudgment granting separation has obtained legal validity, without prejudice to the rights of the wife to\nsubmit evidence which is admissible in order to prove that her husband is the father of the child. If the\nhusband's denial has been declared valid, the reconciliation of the spouses shall not result in the child\nbeing granted legitimate status.\nArticle 255.

If the husband, following the denial, executes a deed\noutside court, and passes away within the stipulated period, his descendants shall be granted a new\nperiod of two months within which to file their legal claim. (Bw.257v., 1058, 1979; Civ.316, 318; See\nS.46-67 below)\nArticle 257. The legal claim filed by a husband, shall lapse, if the heirs do not pursue same within two\nmonths, effective from the date of death of the husband. (Bw.259, 1979)\nArticle 258.

All legal claims for the denial of the legitimacy of a child shall be addressed to the special\nguardian to whom the child is entrusted, and the mother shall be properly summoned in the lawsuit.\n(Bw.102, 110, 310, 359, 1920; Civ.318)\nArticle 261. The descent of legitimate children shall be proven by birth certificates, recorded in the\nregisters of the civil registry. (BS.34) In the absence of such deed, the uninterrupted possession of a\nchild's legitimate status shall be sufficient proof for the child. (Bw.13,101,286;BS.37;Civ.319v.)\nArticle 262. The possession of such status shall be proven by events, which either together or\nseparately, indicate the relationship by descent and kinship between a specific individual and the\n\n\flineage to which he purports to belong. The most significant of these events are, among others: that\nsuch individual has always used the name of the father from whom he claims to be descended ; (Bw.10;\nBS.30) that the father has treated him as his child and as such has provided for his education,\nmaintenance and means of living; (Bw.104, 298v.) that the public has acknowledged him as the father's\nchild; that the next of kin have acknowledged him as such. (Bw.102; Civ.321)\nArticle 263. No one can claim a status that is in violation of that which is stipulated and has been\ngranted in his birth certificate, while at the same time no one can dispute the status held by an individual\npursuant to his birth certificate. (Bw.102; Civ.322)\nArticle 264. In the absence of such certificate and uninterrupted possession of status, or if the child is\nrecorded in the registers under false names, or if the child's natural father or mother are unknown, then\nthe descent may be proven by witnesses. This proof may only be admitted if there is initial written proof;\nor if the allegations or indications, resulting from events which have not been disputed, can be\nconsidered sufficiently significant to admit such as evidence. (Bw.288, 1922; BS.27; Civ.323)\nArticle 265. The initial written proof shall be found in family documents, registers and household\ndocuments belonging to the father or the mother, or also in public or private deeds belonging to an\nindividual, who is involved in the dispute, or if still alive, would have had an interest therein. (Bw.268,\n1881, 1902; BS.27; Civ.324)\nArticle 266. Proof against this may be in any suitable form which indicates that the individual claiming\ndescent is not the child of the woman who he claims to be his mother, or also, in the event that it is\nproven that she is his mother, is not the child of such woman's husband. *78 (Bw.264v., 286v.; Civ.325)\nArticle 267. A civil judge only shall be authorized to deal with appeals in respect of status. (Bw.268,\n1920; Civ.326)\nArticle 268. A lawsuit in respect of false representation of status which carries the penalty of corporal\npunishment may not be filed, prior to the passing of the final judgment regarding the dispute over such\nstatus. The prosecution counsel shall, however, be entitled to file a lawsuit in respect of false\nrepresentation of status which carries the penalty of corporal punishment, if the interested parties\nremain silent, provided that there is initial written proof pursuant to article 265, and if it has been decided\nfrom the start that there is such indication of initial proof. (Bw.268, second paragraph not applicable to\nChinese, see Chinese 1-1 g) In the last instance, the process of the public lawsuit shall not be\nsuspended by any civil suit. (AB.30; Bw.267, 1918;BS.27v.; Sv.409; Sw.529; Civ.337)\nArticle 269. In relation to children, the lawsuit to appeal a certain status shall not be subject to any\nprescribed period of limitation. (Bw.1967, 1986; Civ.328)\nArticle 270. Such a lawsuit may only be filed by the heirs of the child who has not appealed his status in\nthe event that the child died when he was still a minor, or within three years of his reaching the age of\nmajority. (Bw.258, 883, 1058; Civ.329)\nArticle 271. The heirs, may, however, resume such lawsuits, if they have been instituted by the child,\nunless the suit has not been prosecuted within three years after the filing of the last deed. (Bw.257, 833;\nRv.273v.; Civ.330)\nArticle 271a. (Supplemented by S.37-595, effective as of January 1, 1939) An individual whose claim for\ninvocation of a certain status has been granted or who has been permitted to deny the legitimacy of a\nchild, shall have the judgment recorded after it has obtained legal validity in the current registers of\nbirths at the location where the birth was recorded. This shall be mentioned in the margin of the birth\ncertificate.\nSection 2\nConcerning the legitimization of natural children\nArticle 272. Children conceived outside marriage, with the exception of those who have been conceived\nin an adulterous or incestuous relationship, shall be legitimized by the ensuing marriage of their father\nand mother, if the latter-mentioned have acknowledged them legally prior to the concluding of the\n\n\fmarriage, or if the acknowledgment took place at the time of execution of the marriage certificate.\n(Bw.40, 275, 277, 280v., 862, 867; BS.53, 61-9; Civ.331)\nArticle 273. Children, who are born of parents, between whom no marriage would have existed without\ndispensation granted by the Governor General, cannot be legitimized other than by acknowledgment in\nthe marriage certificate. (Bw.29,31,280,283)\nArticle 274. If the parents, prior to or at the time of entering into the marriage, fail to acknowledge their\nnatural children, they may subsequently reverse their position by letter of legitimization, granted by the\nGovernor General, following the advice issued by the Supreme Court. (Ov.16; Bw.276;BS.61-9; Bb.515,\n4941, 6038, 6089, 7488, 8653, 13416, 13421, 13603, 13604, 13605)\nArticle 275. (Amended by S.96-115) In a manner similar to that stipulated in the previous article, the\nfollowing natural and legally acknowledged children may also be legitimized:\n1. children born of parents who cannot enter into their intended marriage as a result of one of the\nparents passing away;\n2. children born of a mother, who is of Indonesian descent or descended from another similar\nindigenous group; if the mother has passed away, or in the event that there are significant objections -at\nthe discretion of the Governor General- to the marriage of the parents. (Bw.272, 276, 278)\nArticle 276. (Amended by S.96-115) In the events, mentioned in the two previous articles, the supreme\ncourt shall if it deems fit, hear or instruct that the blood relatives of the applicants be heard, prior to\nissuing its advice, and shall also order that the request for legitimization shall be announced through the\nappointed public newspapers. (Bw.290)\nArticle 277. (Amended by S.27-31 see also 290, 421) *80 Legitimization, either by the ensuing marriage\nof the parents, or in the events set out in article 274, pursuant to the issuance of letters of legitimization,\nshall result in the same legal regulations being applicable to the children as those which are applicable\nto children born during marriage. (Bw.852; Civ.333)\nArticle 278. (Amended by S.96-115) In the events described in article 275, the legitimization shall only\nbe valid as of the date that the letters are issued by the Governor General; this shall not jeopardize the\nexisting legitimate children with respect to their succession as heirs, similarly, this shall not affect the\nsuccession of other blood relatives as heirs, provided that they have approved the issuance of the\nletters of legitimization. (Bw.852v.)\nArticle 279. In the same manner, and pursuant to the same regulations as mentioned in the previous\narticles, children who have passed away and who have left descendants, can also be legitimized; in\nwhich event, the legitimization shall benefit their descendants. (Bw.272, 274, 842, 852; Civ.332).\nSection 3\nConcerning the acknowledgment of natural children\nArticle 280. The acknowledgment of a natural child shall create a civil relationship between that child\nand his father or mother. (Bw.30v., 40, 47, 272v., 306, 319, 328, 353, 363,862, 871, 873, 908, 916)\nArticle 281. The acknowledgment of a natural child can take place pursuant to any kind of authentic\ndeed, if such has not already taken place by birth certificate, or at the execution of the marriage.\n(Not.37a) Such acknowledgment can also take place pursuant to a deed, drawn up by the official of the\ncivil registry, and recorded as at the date of signing in the birth registry. Such acknowledgment shall be\nmentioned in the margin of the birth certificate, if it is available. (Bw.40, 272, 862, 908, 1868; BS.41, 53,\n61-9; Civ.62, 334) If the acknowledgment of the child was contained in another authentic deed, then\neach interested party may demand that it shall be mentioned in the margin of the birth certificate. Under\nno circumstances shall absence of the notation of an acknowledgment in the margin of the birth\ncertificate be grounds for disputing the status granted.\nArticle 282. The acknowledgment by a minor of a natural child shall be deemed to be invalid unless the\nminor has reached the age of nineteen years, and the acknowledgment is not the result of duress, error,\n\n\fdeceit or enticement. (BS.42) A minor daughter, shall, however, be able to acknowledge a natural child\nprior to her reaching the age of nineteen years. (Bw.29, 108, 330, 446, 452, 1321, 1446, 1449)\nArticle 283. Children conceived in an adulterous or incestuous relationship may not be acknowledged,\nwithout prejudice to the stipulation in article 273, with regard to the latter mentioned. (Bw.30v., 41, 252v.,\n272, 289, 867v.; BS.42; Civ.335)\nArticle 284. (Amended by S.96-108) No acknowledgment of a natural child shall, during the lifetime of\nthe mother, notwithstanding that she may be of Indonesian descent or descended from a similar\nindigenous group, be accepted, if the mother does not approve the acknowledgment. (Bw.280v., 354) If\nsuch child is acknowledged after the death of the *82 mother, such acknowledgment shall have no\nconsequences other than those which relate to the father. (Bw.288; Civ.336) Acknowledgment of a\nnatural child, whose mother is of Indonesian descent or descended from a similar indigenous group,\nshall annul the civil relationship arising from natural descent, without prejudice to the consequences of\nan acknowledgment by the mother, in the event that she is granted the authority due to the ensuing\nmarriage to the father.\nArticle 285. Acknowledgment which takes place in the course of the marriage by one of the spouses, in\norder to benefit the natural child, which he, prior to his marriage has conceived with a person other than\nhis spouse, shall not jeopardize that spouse, nor shall it be detrimental to the children born of that\nmarriage. Such acknowledgment, shall, however, have consequences after the dissolution of that\nmarriage, if there are no remaining descendants from the marriage. Bw.199, 277; Civ.337)\nArticle 286. Any acknowledgment by the father or the mother, including the claim to a certain status by\nthe child may be disputed by those who have an interest therein. (Bw.261v., 282; Civ.339)\nArticle 287. Investigation of paternity shall be prohibited. (Amended by S.17-497) However, in the event\nthat a misdemeanor as described in articles 285 through 288, 294 or 332 of the penal code, was carried\nout which resulted in the pregnancy, then the guilty party, can, upon being charged by the interested\nparties, be declared to be the father of the child. (Bw.252v.; Civ.340)\nArticle 288. Investigation of maternity shall be permitted. In this regard the child is required to prove that\nhe or she was borne by that mother. No proof by witnesses with respect to the child shall be admitted,\nunless there already exists initial written proof. (Bw.265, 1902, 1914; Civ.341)\nArticle 289. No child shall be permitted to investigate his or her paternity or maternity, in the events,\nwhere pursuant to article 283, no acknowledgment can take place. (Civ.342).\nChapter XIII\nConcerning the relationship by blood and marriage\nArticle 290. A blood relationship subsists between persons of whom one descends from the other, or\nbetween persons who have a common ancestor. A blood relationship shall be calculated by the number\nof births; each birth shall be referred to as a degree. (Bw.30, 872v., 877, Civ.735)\nArticle 291. The succession of degrees constitutes a line of descent. A direct line refers to the\nsuccession of degrees between individuals of whom one descends from the other; a collateral line, shall\nbe interpreted as the succession of degrees among individuals, who do not descend one from the other,\nbut who have a common ancestor. (Civ.726)\nArticle 292. A direct line shall be a descerding and ascending line. The former subsists between an\nindividual and his descendants; the latter subsists between an individual and his ascendants. (Bw.842,\n850, 852v., 857; Civ.736)\nArticle 293. One can calculate in the direct line, the number of degrees as well as births there are\namong the individuals; As such, in the descending line, descent from the father to the son, is in the first\ndegree; and from the grandfather to the grandson is in the second, and so forth; and conversely, in the\nascending line, the ascent from the son and grandson to father and grandfather shall be in the first or\nsecond degree and thereafter accordingly. (Civ.737)\n\n\fArticle 294. In the collateral line the degrees shall be calculated by the number of births, first between\none blood relative and the closest common ancestor, and thereafter between them and the other blood\nrelative; as such two brothers shall exist in relation to one another in the second degree, uncles and\ncousins in the third, nephews in the fourth etc. (Bw.850; Civ.738)\nArticle 295. Relationship by marriage is the relationship resulting from a marriage, between one of the\nspouses and the blood relatives of the other. No relationship by marriage shall exist between the mutual\nblood relatives of the spouses. (Bw.30v., 322, 376)\nArticle 296. The degrees of relationship by marriage shall be calculated in the same manner as that\nadopted in blood relationships. (Bw.293)\nArticle 297. The dissolution of a marriage shall not invalidate the relationship by marriage between one\nof the spouses and the blood relatives of the other. (ISR.9; Bw.30v., 199, 322-2,323).\nChapter XIV\nConcerning parental authority\nSection 1\nConcerning the consequences of parental authority with respect to the personal aspects of the\nchild\nPursuant to the law of July 10, 1947, N.S.No.H 232, the previous titles 15,15a and 16 of the Dutch Civil\nCode have been revoked and new titles 15,16 and 16a have been supplemented.

(Amended by S.27-31 see also 390, 421) During the marriage of the parents, the child shall\nbe under their parental authority until he comes of age, to the extent that they are not relieved of such or\ndismissed.

All contracts arise from an agreement, or by law. (Bw. 1313v., 1352; Rv. 102)\nArticle 1234. Their purpose is to provide something, to do or not to do something. (Bw. 1235v., 1239v.,\n1314; Civ. 1101, 1126)\nSection 2\nConcerning contracts to provide something\nArticle 1235. Contracts to provide something include the obligation to deliver the goods and to maintain\nsuch, until the time of the delivery, as they would be maintained if in the care of a good head of the\nhousehold. The extent of the latter-mentioned obligation more or less depends on specific agreements,\nthe consequences of which shall be referred to in the relevant titles. (Bw.105, 385, 612v., 784, 1033,\n1157, 1356, 1444v., 1550-1, 1706v. 1715, 1744, 1801; Civ. 1136v.)\nArticle 1236. The debtor is required to compensate the creditor for costs, damages and interest, in the\nevent that he is unable to deliver the goods, or in the event that he has not properly maintained them.\n(Bw.1235, 1243v., 1264, 1275, 1391, 1444, 1480)\nArticle 1237. With regard to an agreement to provide something, effective as of the conclusion of the\nagreement, this shall become the creditor's liability. Liability of the debtor for failure by him to deliver the\ngoods shall arise from the time of the default. (Bw.1264, 1275, 1391, 14444, 1460, 1481v., 1545, 1553,\n1605, 1648, 1708, 1745v.; Civ. 1138)\nArticle 1238. The debtor shall be declared to have defaulted, either by an order or other such similar\ndeed, or pursuant to the contract itself, which stipulates that the debtor shall be in default, upon failure to\ndeliver within the stipulated time period. (Bw. 391, 413, 579, 1243, 1362, 1626, 1805, 1979; Rv. 1v.; Civ.\n1139)\nSection 5\nConditional Obligations\nArticle 1253. An obligation is conditional if it is conditioned upon an event that may occur and is yet to\noccur, be it by way of deferring the obligation’s entry into force or annulling the obligation, depending on\nwhether such event occurs.\n\n\fArticle 1254. All terms that are intended to do something that cannot be done, something that is contrary\nto morality, or something that is prohibited by the law is void and render agreements conditioned upon\nthem inapplicable.\nArticle 1255. Terms that are intended to do something that cannot be done do not cause the obligations\nthat are conditioned upon them to be inapplicable\nArticle 1256. All obligations are void, if their executions solely depend on the willingness of the person\nbound. However if obligation depends on an act whose execution is within the power of that person, and\nsuch act has already occurred then such obligation is valid.\nArticle 1257. All terms must be fulfilled in the manner intended and meant by the parties concerned.\nArticle 1258. If an obligation depends on an event that will happen within a certain time, then such term\nis deemed not to have existed, if such time has passed while such term may be fulfilled at any time, and\nsuch term is not deemed not to have existed before it is certain that the event will not happen.\nArticle 1259. If an obligation is conditioned upon the terms that an event will not take place within certain\ntime, then such term is fulfilled where such time elapses and the event has not taken place. Similarly, if\nsuch term is met, if before such time elapses it is certain that the event will not happen, but the time is\nnot fixed, then such term is not met before there is certainty that such event will not happen.\nArticle 1260. Such terms are deemed fulfilled if the debtor prevents the fulfilment of such terms.\nArticle 1261. If the conditions are met, then such terms apply retroactively to such time the obligation\narises. If the creditor passes before the term is fulfilled, then the rights pass to his successors.\nArticle 1262. A creditor may take all necessary efforts to prevent losing his rights before such terms are\nmet.\nArticle 1263. An obligation with terms of delay is an obligation that depends on a future event and is not\ncertain to occur, or depends on an event that has already occurred and is not known to the parties.\nIn the first case, the obligation is not executable until such time the event occurs; in the second case,\nthe obligation arises when such event arises.\nArticle 1264. If an obligation depends on deferred terms, then the objects of the obligation remains\nwithin the responsibility of the debtor, who is only obliged to deliver the goods when the terms are met. If\nsuch goods perish beyond the debtor’s fault, then the obligation no longer exists between the parties. If\nthe object depreciates beyond the debtor’s faults then the creditor may choose: terminate the obligation\nor demand delivery of the object in its current state without price reduction.\nIf the object depreciates due to the fault of the debtor, then the creditor may terminate the obligation or\ndemand the delivery of the object with compensation.\nArticle 1265. A void condition is a term, which if met would cause the obligation to become void and\nrestitute the parties as though the obligation has never existed\nThis term does not delay the fulfilment of the obligation; it only obliges the creditor to return what he\nreceives, if such event occurs.\nArticle 1266. A void condition is deemed to have been included in a reciprocal agreement, where a party\ndoes not fulfil his obligation. In such case, the agreement is not void by law, but voidance must be\nrequested to the court.\nThe request must also be done, even though the terms of voidance concerning the non-fulfilment of an\nobligation is included in the agreement. If the terms of voidance is not included in the agreement, then\nthe judge, considering the situation, upon the defendant’s request, has the discretion to fix a timeframe\nto fulfil such obligations, but such timeframe may not exceed one month.\n\n\fArticle 1267. Party against whom the obligation is not fulfilled; forces the counterparty to fulfil the\nagreement where such fulfilment is still possible, or demand the termination of such agreement, with\ncompensation of costs, damages and interests.\nSection 3\nDivisible and indivisible contracts\nArticle 1296. A contract is divisible or indivisible if the subject is goods the delivery of which, or a deed\nthe implementation of which is susceptible to division, tangible or intangible.

A contract is indivisible, notwithstanding that the goods or deed that form the subject\nmatter are, by nature, divisible, if the entirety of the contract itself cannot be partly implemented in part.\n(Bw. 1160, 1300v.; Civ. 1218)\nArticle 1298. A contract shall not be deemed to be indivisible on the basis that it is a several liability\ncontract. (Bw. 1283, 1292, 1301v., 1983; Civ. 1219)\nArticle 1299. A contract which is not divisible shall be executed by the debtor and the creditor, as if such\ncontract is indivisible; divisibility shall only apply to their heirs who cannot claim the debt, or who are not\nobligated to settle such, but only to the extent of the share which they have inherited or for which they\nare liable as representatives of the creditor or the debtor. (Bw. 1100v., 1311v., 1390, 1527v., 1721; Civ.\n1220)\nArticle 1300. The provisions set out in the previous article shall be excepted with respect to the heirs of\nthe debtor in the following matters:\n1. in the event that the debt relates to a mortgage; (Bw. 1101v., 1105, 1163, 1198)\n2. if the debt comprises specific goods; (Bw. 1083, 1391)\n3. with respect to a debt comprising alternative goods, to be selected by the creditor, if one of the goods\nproves to be indivisible; (Bw. 1272v.)\n4. if, according to the agreement, only one of the heirs is obliged to perform the contract; (Bw. 800, 959,\n965, 967).\n5. if, either due to the nature of the contract, or due to the goods which form the subject matter, or due to\nthe intent set out in the contract, it is apparent that it is the parties' intent that the debt shall not be\nsettled in parts. (Bw. 1297) In the first three instances, the heir who is in possession of the goods owed,\nor of the goods which serve as security for the debt, shall be prosecuted for the entire *353 debt, or for\nthe encumbered goods, without prejudice to his right to recover from the other heirs. In the fourth\ninstance, only the heir who is liable for the debt may be prosecuted, and in the fifth instance, each heir\ncan also be prosecuted for the entire debt, without prejudice to the right of the latter-mentioned to\nrecover from the other heirs. (Civ. 1221)\nArticle 1301. Each individual, who jointly is responsible for an indivisible debt, is liable for the entire debt,\neven though the contract was not concluded subject to several liability. (Bw. 1160, 1163, 1278v., 1297,\n1310; Civ. 1222)\nArticle 1302. The same shall also apply to the heirs of those individuals, who are bound by a similar\ncontract. (Bw. 1102v., 1310, 1721; Civ. 1223)\nArticle 1303. Each heir of the creditor may demand the implementation of an indivisible contract in its\nentirety. An individual heir shall not discharge the entire debt, or receive the value thereof, instead of the\ngoods.

(Bw. 1278, 1289, 1385, 1438, 1721; Civ.\n1224).\n\n\fSection 4\nConcerning contracts subject to punishment and penalization\nArticle 1304. A stipulation in respect of punishment is a stipulation which ensures the execution of a\ncontract by imposing an obligation on an individual in the event that the contract is not complied with.\n(Bw. 1243, 1249; Civ. 1226)\nArticle 1305. The nullification of the principal contract shall also render the stipulation regarding\npunishment void. However, the nullification of the stipulation regarding punishment shall, in no manner,\nrender the principal contract void. (Bw. 1315, 1317; Civ. 1227)\nArticle 1306. The creditor, may, instead of invoking the punishment against the debtor who is in breach,\ndemand the fulfillment of the principal contract.(Civ. 1228)\nArticle 1307. The stipulation regarding punishment shall be invoked in lieu of compensation of costs,\ndamages and interest, for the creditor's loss resulting from failure to comply with the principal contract.\nHowever, he shall not seek the principal debt and the punishment simultaneously, unless the lattermentioned is imposed in the event of delay of the execution of the contract. (Bw. 1243, 1249, 1312; Civ.\n1229)\nArticle 1308. Whether or not the original contract stipulates a specific time period within which the\ncontract must be executed, the punishment shall not be imposed until the individual who is bound to\nprovide something, or to receive something, or to do something, has failed to do so. (Bw. 1235, 1238,\n1243, 1245, 1250, 1268; Civ. 1230)\nArticle 1309. The punishment may be revised by the judge, in the event that the principal contract has\nbeen partly complied with. (Bw. 1249; civ. 1231)\nArticle 1310. If the original contract, containing a provision for punishment, concerns indivisible assets,\nthe punishment shall be imposed as a result of breach by any one of the heirs of the debtor and the\nentire debt may be claimed either from the individual who is in breach, or the respective shares can be\nclaimed from each heir, without prejudice to their rights to claim compensation from the individual as a\nresult of whom the punishment has been imposed, regardless of the rights of secured creditors. (Bw.\n116, 1285, 1301; Civ. 1232)\nArticle 1311. In the event that the original contract *355 containing a provision regarding punishment is\ndivisible, the punishment shall be imposed solely upon the heirs of the debtor who have breached this\ncontract, and to the extent only of his share in the principal contract, and no lawsuit shall be filed against\nthe individuals who have complied with the contract. There shall be an exception to this rule if the\nprovision regarding punishment is included with the intent that performance shall not occur in parts, and\nif one of the heirs has obstructed the entire performance of the contract; in this event, the punishment of\nthe latter-mentioned may be imposed in its entirety, and with respect to the other heirs only in relation to\ntheir shares, without prejudice to their right for compensation. (Bw. 1200, 1306; Civ. 1233)\nArticle 1312. If a divisible principal contract, which contains a stipulation of indivisible punishment, has\nonly been complied with partially, the punishment shall, with regard to the heirs of the debtor, be\nreplaced by compensation of costs, damages and interest.

Notwithstanding this, an individual may guarantee the fulfillment of a third party's\ncommitments, without prejudice to the claim for compensation of damages against the individual who\nhas guaranteed the third party or has agreed to secure the third party, if such third party refuses to fulfill\nthe contract. (Bw. 1338, 1645, 1823, 1873; Civ. 1120)\nArticle 1317. An individual may also enter into an agreement on behalf of a third party, if such\nagreement, which the individual concludes on his own behalf, or gift granted by him to another party,\ncontains a provision in this regard. An individual, who has concluded an agreement, cannot revoke\nsuch, if the third party has declared his intent to exercise it. (Bw. 1323, 1338, 1669v., 1688, 1778, 1823;\nCiv. 1121)\nArticle 1318. An individual shall be presumed to have entered into an agreement on behalf of himself,\nand on behalf of his heirs and individuals having rights thereto, unless the contrary is expressly\nstipulated or is apparent from the nature of the agreement.(Bw. 175, 178, 807-1, 833, 955, 1575, 1612,\n1743, 1784, 1813, 1826; Civ. 1122)\nArticle 1319.

An error shall not render an agreement invalid unless such error relates to the substance of\nthe subject matter of the agreement. Error shall not result in invalidity if it relates only to the identity of an\nintended party to the contract, unless the agreement is solely concluded with regard to this specific\nindividual. (Bw. 1618, 1666, 1851v.; Civ. 1110)\nArticle 1323. Duress against an individual who has entered into an agreement, shall forms grounds for\nnullification of the agreement, notwithstanding that it was committed by a third party, who was not party\nto the said agreement. (Bw. 893, 1053, 1065, 1325; Civ. 1111)\nArticle 1324. Duress takes place if it is of such nature that it results in a reasonable individual being\ncoerced, and if it frightens him in such a way that he could expose himself or his wealth to considerable\nand immediate existing disadvantage. In consideration thereof, one shall have regard to the age, sex\nand the status of the individuals involved. (Civ. 1112)\nArticle 1325. Duress shall invalidate an agreement not only if it is committed against one of the\nundertaking parties, but also if it is committed against their spouses or kin in the ascending or\ndescending line.

The fear caused by deference towards father, *359 mother or other kin in the ascending\nline, shall, without additional duress, be insufficient for the nullification of the agreement. (Bw. 298; Civ.\n1114)\nArticle 1327. An individual cannot claim nullification of an agreement based upon duress, if, following the\ncessation of duress, the agreement is approved, whether expressly or impliedly, or if the individual has\nallowed the time period stipulated by law for re-instatement of the agreement in its entirety, to lapse.\n(Bw. 1115, 1449v., 1454, 1456, 1892; Civ. 1115)\nArticle 1328.

(Bw. 1178, 1523, 1815, 1818, 1857; F.152; Civ. 1165)\nArticle 1341. (S.06-348) However, each creditor may invalidate any acts which were not compulsory,\ncommitted by the debtor, in any name, which are detrimental to the creditors, provided that it is proven\nthat while committing the acts, the debtor as well as the individual with whom he committed the act or on\nwhose behalf he acted, was aware that it would result in detriment to the creditors. Rights, which were\nobtained by a third party in good faith over the goods which were the subject matter of the invalid action,\nshall be honored. To nullify the acts committed by the debtor for free, it shall suffice if the creditor\ndisplays that the debtor was aware at the time the act was committed that he would jeopardize his\ncreditors, regardless of whether or not the beneficial party shared that knowledge. (Bw. 192, 920, 977,\n1061, 1067, 1166, 1185, 1454, 1922, 1952; Credverb. 5; F.30, 41v.; Civ. 1167)\nSection 4\nInterpretation of agreements\nArticle 1342.

(Bw. 886, 1257,\n1473, 1855; Civ. 1156)\nArticle 1344. In the event that a stipulation is open to two interpretations, one shall interpret it in the\nsense in which it produces some effect, rather than in the sense in which it would be entirely ineffective.\n(Bw. 887; Civ. 1157)\nArticle 1345. Wording which is open to two kinds of interpretation shall be interpreted in the sense which\ncorresponds most with the nature of the agreement. (Bw. 887; Civ. 1158)\nArticle 1346. If the wording is ambiguous, it shall be interpreted in a manner which is customary in the\ncountry or in the location where the agreement was entered into. (AB. 15; Civ. 1159)\nArticle 1347.

(Bw. 1273, 1473, 1509,\n1865, 1879; Civ. 1162)\nArticle 1350. Regardless of the generality of the wording of an agreement, it shall cover the matters\nregarding which the parties clearly intend to enter into the agreement. (Bw. 1854; Civ. 1163)\nArticle 1351. If a party has specified something in an agreement for the purpose of clarifying the\ncontract, then he shall not be considered to have restricted and limited the binding validity by law, which\nis contained in the unexpressed cases.

A labor agreement is an agreement in which one party, the laborer, agrees to render his\nservices to the other party, the employer, for a specific term in return for remuneration. (Bw. 1603e,\n1603y)\nArticle 1601b. The contract for work is the agreement by which one party, the contractor, binds himself\nto the other party, the client, to carry out specific tasks for a specific price. (Bw. 1604v.)\nArticle 1601c. If an agreement contains the features of a labor agreement and of any other kind of\nagreement, then the provisions regarding a labor agreement as well as those relevant to another kind of\nagreement, which also have the same features, shall apply; in the event of a dispute regarding these\nprovisions, those relating to the labor agreement shall apply. If a contract for work is followed by more\nsimilar agreements, whether directly or otherwise, or if, upon the conclusion or execution of the contract\nfor work, it appears that the intention of the parties is to conclude more such similar agreements in such\nmanner that the various contracts shall be regarded as a joint labor agreement, then the stipulations\nregarding the labor agreement shall be applicable to these agreements on a joint and several basis, with\nthe exception of the stipulations of the sixth section of this title. If, however, in such case, the first\nagreement has been concluded for test purposes only, it shall be deemed to have retained its nature as\na contract for work and the stipulations of the sixth section shall then apply to it. (Bw.1603x, 1604v.)\nSection 2\nConcerning labor agreements in general\nArticle 1601d. In the event that a labor agreement is concluded in writing, the costs of the deed and\nother additional costs shall be borne by the employer. (Bw. 1466, 1601y)\n\n\fArticle 1601e. If, upon concluding the agreement, a deposit has been provided and accepted, it shall not\nauthorize the parties to cancel the agreement by ordering the retention or return of the deposit. The\ndeposit may only be deducted from the wage, if the services have not been rendered for longer than\nthree months, whereas the agreement has been entered into for a longer or unspecified time period.\nArticle 1601f. With regard to labor agreements concluded by a married woman as a laborer, the law\nshall presume that she has obtained the approval of her husband. She can, therefore, commit all acts in\nrelation to these agreements, to grant a discharge and to appear in court, without the assistance of her\nhusband. She shall be entitled to use whatever she has received or claimed pursuant to the executed\nlabor agreement, for the benefit of her family. (Bw. 108v., 111, 1916; F.20-2)\nArticle 1601g. A minor shall be competent to conclude a labor agreement as a laborer, if he has been\ngiven either verbal or written authorization to do so by his legal representative. A verbal authorization\ncan only apply to the conclusion of a certain labor agreement. If the minor has not reached the age of\neighteen years, then the authorization shall be granted in the presence of the employer, or of the\nindividual who acts on his behalf. The authorization cannot be conditional. If the authorization is issued\nin writing, the minor must submit the authorization to the employer, who shall immediately issue a\ncertified copy to the minor and shall return the authorization to the minor or to the individual who is\nentitled to it upon termination of the labor agreement. To the extent that the authorization is not subject\nto certain specific stipulations, the minor in the performance of anything that is related to the labor\nagreement entered into by him pursuant to the authorization issued, shall be equal to an adult, without\nprejudice to the provision in the third paragraph of article 1602f. However, he cannot appear in court\nwithout the support of his legal representative, unless it is apparent to the judge that the *423 legal\nrepresentative is incapable of expressing himself. (Bw. 1446, 1603m; Rv.944)\nArticle 1601h. If an incompetent minor has concluded a labor agreement and as a result thereof, without\nany objection from his legal representative, has worked in his employer's service for a period of six\nweeks, he shall be regarded as having been authorized verbally by his representative to conclude his\nlabor agreement. (Bw. 1446, 1454, 1916; S.26-335,article V, pg.603)\nArticle 1601i. A labor agreement concluded between two spouses shall be void. (Bw. 106v., 1467, 1678)\nArticle 1601j. (S.39-546; 47-208) A regulation stipulated by the employer shall only bind the laborer if he\nhas declared in writing that he agrees with such regulation and if the following is complied with:\n(Bw.1601m, 1601x)\n1. that a complete copy of the regulation shall be furnished to the laborer free of charge by or on behalf\nof the employer;\n2. that a signed complete copy of the regulation has been submitted by or on behalf of the employer to\nthe Department of social affairs (Afdeling Arbeid van het Departtement van sociale Zaken) for the\npublic's review;\n3. that a complete copy of the regulations shall be displayed at a location that is accessible by the\nlaborer, preferably in the workplace, where it shall be visible and legible. The submission and the review\nof the regulations at the Department of social affairs shall be free of charge. Each interested party may\nobtain a free copy of the regulations from the Department of social affairs. Each stipulation, which\nviolates any provision of this article shall be void. (AB. 23; Bw. 1320-1, 1601y; K.402, 428)\nArticle 1601k. If, during the service relationship, a regulation shall be stipulated or an existing one shall\nbe amended, the new regulation or the amended one shall bind the laborer only if a complete copy of\nthe draft or of the proposed amendments has been submitted to him for his review, prior to the\nconfirmation thereof during such a time period and without any charge, so that he may be properly\nadvised of the contents. If the laborer, following the stipulation of the new or the amended regulation,\ndoes not agree, then within a period of four weeks after he has become aware of the stipulation, he may\nrequest the termination of the labor agreement from the judge. The judge shall decide after the hearing\nor proper summons of the opposing party in the highest instance and shall approve the request, unless\nhe is of the opinion that the laborer's interest shall not or shall not to a serious extent be disadvantaged\nas a result of the new or amended regulation. Pending the decision of the judge and upon denial of the\nrequest, the service contract shall continue and the new or amended regulation *424 shall apply as of\nthe day on which it was effected. If the request is granted, the judge shall decide when the service\ncontract shall terminate and the laborer shall be entitled to compensation as stipulated in article 1603q\nwhich relates to termination by the employer. Each stipulation which violates any provision of this article\nshall be void. (AB.23; Bw.1603h and i; K.402, 428)\n\n\fArticle 1601l. A statement from a laborer, in which he covenants to agree with any regulation to be\nstipulated in future or any future amendment to an existing regulation shall be void. (AB.23; K.402,428)\nArticle 1601m. The stipulations of the regulation can only be deviated from by specific written\nagreement. (Bw. 1601d; K.402, 428)\nArticle 1601n. Each stipulation between the employer and the laborer, which violates a collective labor\nagreement to which they are both bound, shall be declared void if a claim has been filed by any party to\nthe collective labor agreement, with the exception of the employer himself. A collective labor agreement\nshall be interpreted as a an arrangement, drawn up by one or more employers or one or more\nassociations of employers which form legal entities, with one or more associations of laborers which\nform legal entities, concerning labor conditions, which must be taken into account at the time the labor\nagreements are concluded. (RO.116g)\nArticle 1601o. In calculating the daily wage for the purpose of this title, a day shall consist of ten hours, a\nweek of six days, a month of twenty five days and a year of three hundred days. In the event that the\nwage, either in its entirety or partially, shall be determined in a manner other than in terms of time, then\nthe daily wage shall be computed according to the average wage of the laborer, computed over the last\nthirty working days; in the absence of this criteria, the wage shall be determined as the customary wage\nfor the labor that is most similar in nature, location and time. (Bw. 1603q)\nArticle 1601p. The wage of laborers, who are not given lodgings by the employer, shall not be stipulated\notherwise than in terms of the following:\n1. monetary;\n2. food for consumption including food supplements, lighting and fuel supplies for use at the location\nwhere they are distributed;\n3. clothing, to be worn by the laborers in the performance of their services;\n4. a specific amount of the products of the company, from which the wage is earned, or the basic or\nsupplementary material used by that company, to the extent that the nature and amount of the products\nor basic or supplementary material form the basic necessities of life for the *425 laborer and his family,\nor are used by the company which employs the laborer, as basic or supplementary material, implements\nor tools, but in no circumstances shall it include alcoholic drinks and opium;\n5. the use of a specific piece of land or pasture or stables for a stipulated number of animals according\nto kind, belonging to the laborer or one of the members of his family, the use of work tools or equipment,\nincluding the maintenance thereof;\n6. specific labor or services, by or on behalf of the employer performed for the laborer;\n7. the use of a designated residence or part thereof, free medical treatment for the laborer and his\nfamily, free use of one or more servants, of an automobile or other means of transportation or of one or\nmore horses and other such similar allowances which reduce the expenses of the household, to the\nextent that it is not yet included in the previous provisions;\n8. a stipend during a period of leave after a specific number of years of service, or the entitlement to free\ntransportation to the place of origin or to and from the place where leave shall be taken. (Bw. 1601r;\nK.429)\nArticle 1601q. In the event that no specific wage has been stipulated pursuant to an agreement or\nregulation, the laborer shall be entitled to such wage that at the time the agreement was concluded,\nwould customarily have been stipulated for a similar job at the location where it is performed. If no such\ncustom exists, the wage shall be reasonably determined by taking into account the circumstances.\n(K.402)\nArticle 1601r. To the extent that a wage, other than that permitted in article 1601 p, is stipulated, the\namount shall be evaluated in monetary terms and shall be deemed to be stipulated as five times the\namount. The entire wage due shall, however, not exceed more than one third of the wage determined in\n\n\faccordance with the provisions of the previous article. Any stipulation which violates any provision of this\narticle shall be void. (AB.23; Bw.1602i; K.429)\nArticle 1601s. Each agreement between the employer or one of his officials or supervisors and one of\nthe laborers who is under their supervision shall be prohibited and void, if it provides that the laborer\nshall be obliged to spend his wage or other income or part thereof in a specific manner, or to obtain his\nnecessaries from a specific place or from a specific individual. (AB.23; Bw. 1601 p and t) This provision\nshall not apply to a stipulation which provides for participation by the laborer in a fund, provided that the\nfund complies with the conditions stipulated by ordinance. (Bw. 1602r, paragraph 1 sub 3; S.26-377*)\n*426 Article 1601t. If the laborer, notwithstanding a prohibited and void stipulation as mentioned in the\nprevious article, has concluded an agreement with the employer, no contract shall result therefrom. The\nlaborer shall be entitled to reclaim the money that was deducted from his wage and the costs incurred in\nconcluding the agreement, without being bound to return that which has been given to him to fulfill the\nagreement. The judge shall however be authorized, pursuant to admittance of the laborer's claim, to\nlimit the judgment to such amount as would appear fair having regard to the circumstances, but shall\ngrant the amount, which, according to his evaluation, is the amount in respect of the loss suffered by the\nlaborer. If the laborer, despite a prohibited and void stipulation, as aforementioned, concludes an\nagreement with a person other than the employer, he shall be entitled to claim the amount that he has\npaid pursuant to such agreement or whatever remains owing and may be claimed from the employer.\nThe provisions of the second paragraph shall also apply to this. Each laborer's right to claim pursuant to\nthis article shall lapse after a period of six months. (Bw. 1602j, par.3, 1603t)\nArticle 1601u. The employer shall impose a fine in the event of violation of the conditions of an\nagreement concluded in writing or of a regulation, if the conditions are stipulated and the fine is specified\nin the agreement or the regulation. (Bw. 1601j) The agreement or the regulation, in which the fine is\nstipulated, shall clearly specify the purpose of the fine. They shall not, either directly or indirectly\npersonally benefit the employer or the individual who has been authorized to impose the fine on the\nlaborers. Each fine, stipulated in a regulation or agreement, shall be specified in a specific amount, in\nthe currency that is used for the wage. (Bw. 1602h) The total amount of fines imposed on the laborer\nwithin a week, shall never be higher than the amount of his daily wage. No fine imposed shall be higher\nthan this amount. (Bw. 1601e, 1601o) Each stipulation which violates any provision of this article shall\nbe void. However, deviations from the second, third, fourth paragraphs shall be permitted in agreements\nconcluded in writing or in a regulation but only with regard to laborers who earn more then eight guilders\nper day. If this occurs, then the judge shall be authorized to stipulate a smaller fine if the aforementioned\namount appears unreasonable to him. (AB.23; Bw.1309) The stipulation in respect of punishment by the\nemployer, as mentioned in the tenth section of the first chapter of this Book shall apply to the stipulation\nand the specification of fines within the meaning of this article. (Bw.1306, 1601x, 1602r, first paragraph\nsub 2; K.410)\nArticle 1601v. The employer shall not be permitted to impose fines and claim compensation at the same\ntime in relation to the same matter. (Bw. 1307) *427 Each stipulation which violates this provision shall\nbe void. (AB.23)\nArticle 1601w. If one of the parties intentionally or due to his actions breaches one of his obligations and\nthe damage suffered by the opposition as a result thereof cannot be evaluated in terms of money, the\njudge shall, in a fair manner, stipulate a sum of money as compensation. (Bw. 1241)\nArticle 1601x. An agreement between the employer and the laborer, which restricts the latter-mentioned,\nfollowing the termination of his employment, in his capacity to be employed in a certain manner shall be\nvalid only if it has been agreed with an adult laborer in writing or in a regulation. (Bw. 1601j) The judge,\nmay, either based on a claim of the laborer or upon his defense in a dispute, nullify such an agreement\nin its entirety or partially, on grounds that, the comparison between the interest of the employer to be\nprotected and that of the laborer shows that the laborer has been unfairly disadvantaged by such\nagreement. With regard to the agreement mentioned in the first paragraph, the employer cannot assume\nany rights, if he has terminated the employment unlawfully, or if the laborer intentionally or due to his\nown fault has submitted an urgent reason to terminate the employment and has exercised this authority,\nor if the judge at the request or pursuant to a claim by the laborer has declared the labor agreement to\nbe terminated based upon urgent reasons which were submitted by the laborer and caused intentionally\nby or due to the actions of the employer. (Bw. 1603e, 1603n, 1603p) If the employer of the laborer has\nnegotiated compensation to apply in the event of a violation by the latter-mentioned of a provision as\nmentioned in the first paragraph, the judge shall be authorized to reduce the compensation to a smaller\nsum, if the agreed sum appears to be excessive. (Bw. 1309, 1611u; K. 404)\n\n\fArticle 1601y. Revoked: S.28-533 see also 29-261, currently article VI C, pg.603.\nSection 3\nConcerning the obligations of employers\nArticle 1602. An employer is obligated to pay the wage of the laborer at a stipulated time. (Bw. 1601 o-r\np-2 sub 3; F.232)\nArticle 1602a. The wage payable in respect of a certain period of time is due from the date upon which\nthe laborer is employed until the termination of his employment. (Bw. 1601 o).\nArticle 1602b. No wage shall be due in respect of a period during which the laborer has not performed\nthe agreed labor.\nArticle 1602c. However, the laborer shall be entitled to the wage stipulated to be payable in respect of a\ncertain period of time, for a relatively short time period, if, as a result of illness or accident, he is\nprevented from performing his tasks, unless the illness or accident has been caused intentionally or as a\nresult of his misconduct, or is the result of a physical handicap in respect of which he has deliberately\nsubmitted false information to the employer upon concluding the agreement. (Bw.1244v.) (S.39-256,\n292) If, however, he receives monetary compensation or benefits in such case as a result of legal\nregulations regarding illness or accidents, or pursuant to insurance or from certain funds, in which\nparticipation is mandatory, or which result from the labor agreement, then the wage shall be reduced by\nthe amount of the compensation or benefit. (Bw. 1601 s; S.39-255*, 256*, 693*) The laborer shall also\nretain his rights to the wage payable in respect of a certain period of time for a shorter time period\ncomputed in a fair manner, if he, without monetary compensation, either in compliance with an\nobligation imposed by law or authority which could not have been fulfilled outside his hours of work, or\nas a result of very special circumstances beyond his control, was prevented from performing his tasks.\n(Bw. 1602 u) The following shall be interpreted as very special circumstances for the purpose of this\narticle: the delivery of a child by the spouse of the laborer, the demise and funeral of one of his coinhabitants or one of his kin or relatives by marriage unlimited in the direct line and in the second degree\nof the collateral line. The exercise of the voting right shall also be interpreted as compliance with an\nobligation imposed by the law or authority. (Bw. 290v.) In the event that the monetary wage is stipulated\nin a *429 manner other than in respect of a certain period of time, the provisions of this article shall also\napply, provided that the wage shall be deemed to be the customary wage which the laborer would have\nearned during that time if he had not been prevented from doing so. The wage, however, shall be\nreduced by the amount of the expenses which the laborer has saved by not performing the labor. The\nprovisions of this article may only be deviated from by written agreement or regulation. (Bw. 1601j;\nK.412, 416h)\nArticle 1602d. The laborer shall not lose his right in respect of a wage agreed in respect of a certain\nperiod of time, if he has been willing to perform the agreed tasks, but the employer has not made use of\nthis, either due to his fault or due to an incidental obstruction to him personally. The provisions of the\nsecond, fifth, sixth and seventh paragraphs of the aforementioned article are applicable hereto.\nArticle 1602e. If the wage consists entirely or partially of an amount that is dependent on information\nwhich should have been apparent from the employer's bookkeeping, then the laborer shall be entitled to\nrequest information, regarding the evidence which would be required to know the amount of his wage,\nfrom the employer. It may be stipulated by written agreement or regulation that notification of the\naforementioned evidence, instead of being submitted to each laborer separately, shall be submitted to a\nstipulated number of laborers in the service of the employer or to one or more experts in the\nbookkeeping section which shall be selected by the laborers in writing. The notification of evidence by or\non behalf of the employer shall be given in confidence, if such is expressly requested by the laborer and\nthe individual with whom he is replaced in accordance with the previous paragraph; the lattermentioned, however, can never be bound to the laborer to observe confidentiality. The requirement for\nsecrecy shall be abolished insofar as is necessary, if this matter is disputed in court. (Supplemented\nwith S.31-367 see also 368) To the extent that the information, referred to in the first paragraph,\nconcerns the profit gained by the employer's undertaking or part thereof, the provisions of the first\nparagraph, either stipulated in a written agreement or regulation, may be deviated from which may be in\na manner other than that described in the second paragraph, provided that, having regard to the\nprovisions of the second paragraph, the laborer shall always be given an explicit and clear notification,\nwhich describes the computation of the amount referred to in the first paragraph. (supplemented with\nS.31-368) Without prejudice to the application of the fourth paragraph, the notification as mentioned in\n\n\fthe previous paragraph shall occur, if so desired, pursuant to express requirement for confidentiality by\nthe laborer as described in the third paragraph. (Bw.1601j, 1602n; Sw.323)\n*430 Article 1602f. In order to pay the wage owed to the laborer, the authorization referred to in the first\nparagraph of article 1385 shall be in writing. If it is stipulated in the written authorization, as mentioned in\narticle 1601 g, that the wage in the form of money shall entirely or partially be given to the legal\nrepresentative, instead of being handed to the minor, then he shall, with respect to the payment of the\nwage, or the part thereof which is due him, be regarded as the laborer. Notwithstanding that no such\ncondition has been included in written authorization, or even in the verbal authorization, the monetary\nwage due to the minor shall be given to the legal representative, if he opposes in writing, the payment of\nthe wage to the minor. In circumstances other than those mentioned in the second and third paragraph\nof this article, the employer shall be released from his obligation to make payment of the wage directly to\nthe minor. (Amended by S.38-622) Payment to third parties, in violation of the provisions of this or the\nnext article, shall be void.\nArticle 1602g. Seizure by the employer of the wage owed to the laborer, if the monetary wage is in the\namount of eight guilders per day or less, shall not apply to more than one fifth of the monetary wage. If\nthe monetary wage is more than eight guilders a day, the seizure shall continue to apply only to one fifth\nof the wage, and shall thereafter be unlimited upon further seizures. There shall be no restrictions if the\npurpose of the seizure is to recoup support payment, to which the employer taking possession is entitled\naccording to the law. (Bw. 1601o; Rv. 451v., 749v.) Transfer, pawning, or any other act pursuant to\nwhich the laborer assigns any right in respect of his wage to a third party, shall be valid only to the\nextent that a seizure of his wage shall be valid. (Bw. 613, 1153) Authorization to claim a wage, in any\nshape or form, issued by the laborer, may be revoked. (Bw. 1792v., 1814) Each agreement, which\nviolates any provision of this article, shall be void. (AB. 23; K.433, 446; F.20-2)\nArticle 1602h. The payment of a wage comprising money shall be made in legal Indonesian currency,\nprovided that the wage stipulated in foreign currency shall be computed according to the rate on the\ndate and at place of payment, or in the event that no rate is obtainable in such location, it shall be in\naccordance with that at the nearest business location where a rate is obtainable. (LN. 53-40 article 8*\npg.392; K.433, 445) Exceptions may be made to the provision in the first paragraph for specific regions\nor part of regions by ordinance.\nArticle 1602j. Payment of the wage in a manner other than that stipulated in the previous two articles,\nshall be void. The laborer shall continue to be entitled to claim the wage due to him from the employer,\nwithout being obliged to return to him that which was received by virtue *431 of the payment which has\nbeen nullified. The judge shall however, be authorized, pursuant to the granting the laborers' claim, to\nrestrict the penalty to such an amount that he deems fair in view of the circumstances, but ultimately to\nthe amount that in his opinion was the amount of loss suffered by the laborer. Each laborer's right to\nclaim pursuant to this article shall lapse after a period of six months. (Bw. 1601 t, paragraph 4; 1603 t)\nArticle 1602k. If the location of payment of the wage is not stipulated in the agreement or regulation or\nby custom, then payment shall occur at the option of the employer, either at the location where the tasks\nare usually performed, or at the office of the employer if this is located at the place where the majority of\nthe laborers reside, or at the residence of the laborer. (Bw. 1393)\nArticle 1602l. The payment of the wage stipulated to be in respect of a certain period of time shall occur\nas follows: (Bw.16020; K.452d) if the wage is stipulated for a week or shorter period of time, after each\nweek; if the wage is stipulated to be in respect of a period of time which is longer than one week, but\nshorter than one month, after the lapse of the period in respect of which the wage is stipulated to be\npayable; if the wage is stipulated on a monthly basis, after every month; if the wage is stipulated to be in\nrespect of a longer period of time than one month, after every quarter. This arrangement may only be\ndeviated from to such extent, that in an agreement concluded in writing or regulation, the payment shall\nbe stipulated to be of a wage in respect of a shorter period of time than one half of a month, after each\nhalf of a month, and of a wage that has been stipulated on a monthly basis, after each quarter. The\npayment of the wage of laborers who live with the employer, shall, in deviating to a certain extent from\nthe above-mentioned provisions, take place every time after the lapse of the period of time, as indicated\nby local custom, unless it has been stipulated by written agreement or regulation that the payment shall\noccur pursuant to the provisions of the first paragraph. (AB.15; Bw. 1601j) The periods of payment,\nunder or pursuant to this article, may always be expedited by the parties upon mutual agreement.\nArticle 1602m. The payment of the wage stipulated in the form of money but not in respect of a certain\nperiod of time, shall take place having regard to the provisions of the previous article, provided that this\nwage shall be deemed to have been stipulated in respect of a period of time for which the wage would\n\n\fusually be stipulated for labor which is the most comparable to the labor for which the wage is owed, in\nterms of nature, location and time. (Bw. 1601 q; K. 452 d)\nArticle 1602n. To the extent that the wage stipulated in the form of money comprises an amount, that is\ndependent *432 upon information which is apparent from the employer's books, payment shall take\nplace every time that the amount of the wage can be determined, provided that the payment shall occur\nat least once a year. To the extent that the information referred to in the first paragraph concerns the\nprofit gained by the employer's undertaking or part thereof, and the nature of the enterprise or the\ncustom results in the profit being stipulated after the lapse of more than one year, it can be agreed by\nwritten agreement or regulation, that the payment shall be made after every stipulation. (Bw. 1601j,\n1602e)\nArticle 1602o. If the monetary wage is stipulated in part to be in respect of a period of time, and in part in\nanother manner, or if the parts of the wage have been stipulated to be in respect of different periods of\ntime, then the provisions of article 1602 l through 1602 n shall apply to each part.\nArticle 1602p. Each payment shall be of the entire amount of the wage due. However, with respect to\nthe wage which is stipulated in the form of money, but dependent on the result of the task to be\nperformed, it may be agreed by written agreement or regulation, that every time, should the possibility\narise, without prejudice to the definite computation upon the first payment date, a specific part of the\nwage shall be paid, which shall comprise at least three fourths of the customary wage for labor which is\nmost comparable in terms of nature, location and time. (Bw. 1390; K. 444)\nArticle 1602q. To the extent that the wage stipulated in the form of money, or the portion thereof that\nremains after deduction of that which the employer is not obliged to pay, and after deduction of that to\nwhich third parties, in accordance with the provisions of this title, shall apply their rights, shall not be\npaid later than after the third working day after such date, on which the payment should have occurred\npursuant to articles 1602l, 1602m and 1602o, then, if this failure to pay is caused by the employer, the\nlaborer shall be entitled to an increase due to the delay, which from the fourth until the eight working day\nshall amount to five hundredth (5%) a day and for each working day thereafter shall amount to one\nhundredth (1%), provided that the increase arising due to delay shall in no circumstances exceed one\nhalf of the amount owing. The judge shall, however, be authorized to restrict the increase to such\namount as he deems appropriate having regard to the circumstances. (K.430, 452c.)
