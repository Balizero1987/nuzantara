{"chunk_id": "OSS-NIB-BUSINESS-LICENSING-LEGAL-PROCESSES-2025-11-Common-Mistakes-Penalties-This-section-highligh", "type": "section", "text": "## 11. Common Mistakes & Penalties This section highlights **frequent errors** made by business owners (especially foreigners) when navigating Indonesia's licensing system, and the **penalties** for non-compliance. --- ### Common Mistake #1: Operating Without NIB or Expired Licenses **What Happens**:\n- Business operates without obtaining NIB\n- Or operates with expired licenses (e.g., expired Sertifikat Standar, expired SLF, expired NPPBCK) **Penalty**:\n- **Immediate business closure** by local DPMPTSP or Satpol PP (Civil Service Police)\n- IDR 100M-500M fine (depends on business size and duration of violation)\n- All equipment and inventory may be seized until fine is paid\n- **Criminal charges** possible under KUHP Article 263 (falsification) if operated with fake licenses **Real Example**:\n- **Operation Wira Waspada (2023)**: 267 companies had licenses revoked, many for operating without valid NIB or failing to renew licenses\n- Villa in Canggu (2024): Closed by Satpol PP for operating without NIB, owner fined IDR 150M, villa sealed for 3 months --- ### Common Mistake #2: Incorrect KBLI Code Selection **What Happens**:\n- Business registers with wrong KBLI code\n- Example: Restaurant (KBLI 56101) also offers villa accommodation but didn't add KBLI 55130\n- Or: Consultant (KBLI 70209) also does IT development but didn't add KBLI 62020 **Why It's a Problem**:\n- Operating outside registered KBLI codes = illegal business activity\n- Risk level may be incorrectly assessed (e.g., bar without alcohol KBLI 56301 → missing NPPBCK) **Penalty**:\n- Warning + requirement to add correct KBLI codes within 1 month\n- If not corrected: Temporary suspension until corrected\n- If continued violations: IDR 50M-200M fine + potential NIB revocation **How to Avoid**:\n- Carefully read KBLI code descriptions before selecting\n- If business has multiple activities, add all relevant KBLI codes\n- Consult KBLI guide (see Section 2) or use OSS search function\n- When in doubt, ask DPMPTSP or legal consultant --- ### Common Mistake #3: Capital Calculation Errors (PT PMA) **What Happens**:\n- Owner thinks \"IDR 10B investment\" = total for whole company\n- **WRONG**: IDR 10B **per KBLI per location** (excludes land/buildings) **Example** (Incorrect Calculation):\n- PT PMA owns: - 1 restaurant in Seminyak (KBLI 56101) - 1 bar in Seminyak (KBLI 56301) - 1 villa in Canggu (KBLI 55130)\n- Owner thinks: \"I need IDR 10B total\"\n- **CORRECT Calculation**: - Restaurant (56101) in Seminyak: IDR 10B - Bar (56301) in Seminyak: IDR 10B (separate KBLI, even though same location) - Villa (55130) in Canggu: IDR 10B (different location) - **Total required**: IDR 30B **Exception (F&B)**:\n- Multiple F&B businesses (restaurants, cafes) in **same regency** (e.g., all in Badung) can share IDR 10B\n- But if in different regencies (e.g., 1 in Badung, 1 in Gianyar), each needs IDR 10B **Penalty**:\n- OSS application rejected if capital too low\n- If already operating: Warning + requirement to increase paid-up capital within 6 months\n- If not corrected: License suspension until corrected --- ### Common Mistake #4: Missing LKPM Reporting **What Happens**:\n- PT PMA forgets to submit LKPM quarterly report\n- Or submits late (after deadline)\n- Or submits with incomplete or false data **Penalty** (Progressive):\n1. **1st missed deadline**: Warning letter from BKPM (via OSS notification + email)\n2. **2nd consecutive missed deadline**: Written warning + grace period (1 month) + potential audit\n3. **3rd consecutive missed deadline**: Administrative sanctions: - Temporary suspension of business licenses - Freezing of investment facilities (tax holidays, tax allowances) - Company flagged in BKPM system (can affect future license applications)\n4. **Continued non-compliance**: **NIB revocation** + business closure + potential deportation of foreign directors **False Data in LKPM**:\n- IDR 100M-500M fine + administrative sanctions\n- If intentional fraud (e.g., inflating investment to appear eligible for tax holiday): Criminal charges under KUHP **Real Impact**:\n- LKPM non-compliance is **#1 reason for PT PMA license revocation** in Indonesia\n- Many PT PMAs fail to realize LKPM is **mandatory every quarter**, not just annually --- ### Common Mistake #5: Selling Alcohol Without NPPBCK **What Happens**:\n- Restaurant or bar sells beer, wine, or spirits without obtaining NPPBCK (Alcohol License)\n- Owner thinks \"I have Sertifikat Standar, that's enough\"\n- **WRONG**: NPPBCK is separate, mandatory license from Bea Cukai (Customs) **Why It's Serious**:\n- Alcohol is **excise good** (barang kena cukai) regulated by Ministry of Finance\n- Selling alcohol without NPPBCK = **illegal alcohol trade** = smuggling\n- Bea Cukai has enforcement powers (raids, seizures, arrests) **Penalty**:\n- IDR 200M-500M fine (or 10x value of alcohol sold, whichever higher)\n- Immediate business closure + sealing of premises\n- All alcohol inventory seized (not returned)\n- **Criminal charges** under Excise Law (UU Cukai): - Prison: 1-5 years - Fine: IDR 100M-1B\n- Deportation of foreign directors/shareholders\n- **Lifetime ban** from NPPBCK (cannot re-apply) **Real Examples**:\n- Bar in Seminyak (2023): Raided by Bea Cukai, found selling spirits without Class C NPPBCK (only had Class A for beer), fined IDR 300M, closed for 6 months, owner deported\n- Restaurant chain (2024): 3 locations selling wine without NPPBCK, total fine IDR 800M across all locations, NPPBCK applications permanently rejected **How to Avoid**:\n- **Always apply for NPPBCK BEFORE selling any alcohol** (beer, wine, spirits)\n- Don't start selling alcohol while NPPBCK application is pending (wait for approval)\n- If adding alcohol to existing restaurant: Add KBLI 56301, update Sertifikat Standar, apply for NPPBCK\n- Submit monthly NPPBCK reports on time (by 10th of following month) --- ### Common Mistake #6: Operating in Wrong Zone **What Happens**:\n- Business operates in location not permitted by zoning regulations (RTRW - Rencana Tata Ruang Wilayah)\n- Example: Commercial business (restaurant, bar, shop) in **green zone** (conservation/agricultural) or **yellow zone** (residential) **Zoning Categories in Bali**:\n- **Green Zone**: Conservation, agriculture, forestry → **No commercial businesses allowed** (except small warungs serving local community)\n- **Yellow Zone**: Residential → **Limited commercial allowed** (small shops, warungs), **No bars, nightclubs, large restaurants**\n- **Orange Zone**: Mixed residential-commercial → Most commercial businesses allowed (restaurants, small hotels, villas)\n- **Red Zone**: Commercial/tourism → All commercial businesses allowed (hotels, bars, nightclubs, malls) **How to Check Zoning**:\n1. Visit local DPMPTSP office\n2. Provide land certificate (SHM) or address\n3. Request **Surat Keterangan Rencana Kabupaten/Kota (SKRK)** - zoning certificate\n4. SKRK will state: Zone color, permitted uses, building restrictions (height, setbacks, building coverage ratio) **Penalty**:\n- OSS application rejected if location is not permitted for selected KBLI code\n- If already operating (e.g., built before checking zoning): **Forced closure** + **Demolition order** (for permanent structures)\n- IDR 50M-500M fine (depends on violation severity)\n- **No compensation** for demolished structures **Real Examples**:\n- Villa in Canggu (2022): Built in green zone (near rice fields), local village (banjar) complained, regency government ordered demolition, owner lost IDR 15B investment (land + construction)\n- Beach club in Pererenan (2023): Operated in yellow zone (residential area), neighbors complained about noise, closed by Satpol PP, never reopened --- ### Common Mistake #7: Employing Foreign Workers Without IMTA **What Happens**:\n- Company hires foreign worker (TKA) without obtaining RPTKA + IMTA\n- Or foreign worker works on tourist visa or business visa (B211A) instead of work visa (KITAS 312) **Why It's Serious**:\n- Working on tourist/business visa = **illegal work** = immigration violation\n- Indonesia has high unemployment → strict enforcement to protect local jobs\n- Immigration has detection systems (cross-checks visa types with employment records) **Penalty**:\n- **For Foreign Worker**: - Immediate detention by Immigration (can be held 10 days) - Deportation + 5-year ban from Indonesia - Blacklisted in immigration database (difficult to get visa for any ASEAN country)\n- **For Employer (Company)**: - IDR 100M-500M fine - Administrative sanctions (license suspension) - **Criminal charges** under Immigration Law: - Prison: 1-5 years for company director - Fine: IDR 500M-1B\n- **For Individual (Business Owner Working Illegally)**: - Deportation + lifetime ban - All assets in Indonesia may be frozen/seized **Real Examples**:\n- Australian restaurateur in Seminyak (2024): Worked as chef on tourist visa, reported by local competitors, detained by Immigration, deported, 5-year ban, restaurant forced to close\n- Russian yoga instructor in Ubud (2023): Taught yoga classes on business visa, raided by Immigration, detained, deported, studio fined IDR 200M **Exceptions (No IMTA Required)**:\n- Foreign directors/commissioners with substantial shares (> 10%) → Considered **investors**, not workers\n- Foreign visitors giving short-term training (< 7 days) under business visa\n- Foreign diplomats/consular staff **How to Avoid**:\n- **ALWAYS apply for RPTKA + IMTA BEFORE hiring foreign worker**\n- Foreign worker must enter Indonesia on **work visa (VITAS 312)** → Convert to KITAS 312 upon arrival\n- Don't let foreign worker start working while IMTA application is pending (wait for approval)\n- For business owners: If you will work actively in business (not just as passive investor/shareholder), you need IMTA --- ### Common Mistake #8: False Information in License Applications **What Happens**:\n- Applicant provides false information in NIB, Sertifikat Standar, or other license applications\n- Examples: - Inflated investment value (to appear eligible for tax incentives) - False employee count (to avoid BPJS contributions) - Fake diplomas/certificates for technical personnel - False ownership structure (nominee arrangements) **Why It's Serious**:\n- Government cross-checks data with: - Tax office (investment, revenue) - BPJS (employee count) - Immigration (foreign worker permits) - Ministry of Law (company ownership)\n- Nominee arrangements for PT PMA are **illegal** (foreigners cannot use Indonesian nominees to circumvent foreign ownership restrictions) **Penalty**:\n- **Administrative**: - Immediate license revocation - IDR 500M-1B fine - Blacklisted from OSS (cannot re-apply for new NIB)\n- **Criminal** (under KUHP Article 263 - Falsification): - Prison: 1-6 years - Fine: IDR 500M-1B\n- **For Nominee Arrangements**: - Company dissolution - All assets seized by state - **No compensation** to foreign investor - Foreign investor banned from Indonesia **Real Examples**:\n- PT PMA hotel company (2024): Inflated investment from IDR 50B to IDR 100B to qualify for tax holiday, BKPM discovered during audit, tax holiday revoked + IDR 500M fine + director prosecuted\n- PT PMA villa company (2023): Used Indonesian nominee to hide 100% foreign ownership (actual ownership 95% foreign, 5% nominee), K3NI investigation found nominee arrangement, company dissolved, foreign investor lost IDR 45B (villa + land), deported --- ### Common Mistake #9: Not Renewing Licenses on Time **What Happens**:\n- Business forgets to renew time-limited licenses before expiry: - Sertifikat Standar (MT): 1-3 years - SLF: 5 years - Tourism Business License: 3 years - Health Certificate (F&B): 1 year - Halal Certificate: 4 years - BPOM Registration: 5 years **Why It's a Problem**:\n- Operating with **expired license** = operating **without license** = illegal\n- Government inspections often happen shortly after license expiry dates (they know when licenses expire) **Penalty**:\n- Warning + grace period (1 month) to renew\n- If not renewed: Business closure until renewed\n- If continued operations with expired license: IDR 50M-200M fine + potential NIB revocation **How to Avoid**:\n- Maintain **license expiry calendar** (Excel, Google Calendar, or project management tool)\n- Set reminders: - 6 months before expiry: Start renewal process (for complex licenses like BPOM, Halal) - 3 months before expiry: Submit renewal application (for SLF, Tourism License) - 1 month before expiry: Follow up on renewal status\n- Assign responsibility to specific person (Operations Manager, Admin Manager) --- ### Common Mistake #10: Poor Record-Keeping **What Happens**:\n- Business doesn't maintain required records: - LKPM submission receipts - Tax payment receipts - BPJS payment receipts - Employee contracts - Training records - Maintenance logs (fire extinguishers, building, equipment) - Incident logs\n- During government inspection, cannot provide documents **Penalty**:\n- Warning + requirement to provide documents within 1 week\n- If cannot provide: Assumption of non-compliance → Administrative sanctions (license suspension until documents provided)\n- Repeat violations: IDR 10M-50M fine + increased inspection frequency (flagged as high-risk) **Best Practices**:\n1. **Digital + Physical Filing**: - Keep digital copies (PDF) on Google Drive, Dropbox, or company server (backup to external hard drive) - Keep physical copies in binders (organized by year, category)\n2. **Folder Structure**: - Licenses (NIB, Sertifikat Standar, PBG/SLF, NPPBCK, Tourism, Health, Halal) - Tax (PPh, PPN, monthly payment receipts) - BPJS (Kesehatan, Ketenagakerjaan, monthly payment receipts) - LKPM (submission receipts, quarterly) - Employees (contracts, BPJS registrations, training records) - Maintenance (fire extinguisher inspections, building repairs, equipment servicing) - Incidents (accidents, complaints, government inspections, resolutions)\n3. **Retention Period**: Keep records for **10 years** (tax records) and **5 years** (other business records) --- ### Penalty Summary Table | Violation | Administrative Penalty | Criminal Penalty |\n|-----------|------------------------|------------------|\n| **Operating without NIB** | Immediate closure + IDR 100M-500M fine | Prison: 1-5 years |\n| **Wrong KBLI code** | Warning → Suspension → IDR 50M-200M fine | N/A |\n| **Insufficient capital (PT PMA)** | Warning → License suspension | N/A |\n| **Missing LKPM (1st time)** | Warning letter | N/A |\n| **Missing LKPM (3x consecutive)** | NIB revocation + business closure | N/A |\n| **Selling alcohol without NPPBCK** | IDR 200M-500M fine + closure + seizure | Prison: 1-5 years, Fine: IDR 100M-1B |\n| **Operating in wrong zone** | Closure + Demolition + IDR 50M-500M fine | N/A |\n| **Foreign worker without IMTA** | IDR 100M-500M fine + license suspension | Prison: 1-5 years, Fine: IDR 500M-1B |\n| **False information in license** | License revocation + IDR 500M-1B fine | Prison: 1-6 years (KUHP 263) |\n| **Expired license** | Warning → Closure + IDR 50M-200M fine | N/A |\n| **Nominee arrangement (PT PMA)** | Company dissolution + Asset seizure + Deportation | Prison: 1-5 years | --- ### How to Minimize Compliance Risks **1. Hire Competent Staff or Consultants**:\n- **In-house**: Operations Manager or Admin Manager with licensing experience\n- **Consultant**: Business license consultant (Konsultan Perizinan), accounting firm, or law firm\n- **Cost**: IDR 5M-30M/year (consultant retainer) or IDR 10M-20M/month (full-time employee) **2. Use Compliance Checklists**:\n- Monthly checklist (BPJS, taxes, NPPBCK report)\n- Quarterly checklist (LKPM)\n- Annual checklist (financial statements, renewals) **3. Set Up Automated Reminders**:\n- Google Calendar with email notifications\n- Project management tools (Asana, Trello, Monday.com)\n- Accounting software with compliance reminders (Accurate, Jurnal, Xero) **4. Attend BKPM/DPMPTSP Socialization Sessions**:\n- BKPM and local DPMPTSP regularly hold free training sessions on OSS, licensing, compliance\n- Subscribe to BKPM newsletters (via OSS account)\n- Follow BKPM social media (Twitter, Instagram) for updates **5.
