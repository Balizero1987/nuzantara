## 🔄 Visa Index Classification Changes (2024) {#visa-index-changes}

### **Overview**

In **January 2024**, the Indonesian government overhauled the visa classification system, replacing old indexes with new codes following new visa regulations.

**Legal Basis**: Minister of Law and Human Rights Regulation (implementation of Permenkumham 22/2023)

---

### **Key Changes**

| Old Index (Pre-2024) | New Index (2024+) | Visa Type | Change Notes |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **B211A** | **211A** | Tourist Visit Visa (60-180 days) | Removed "B" prefix |
| **B211A** | **C2** | Business Single-Entry Visa | Reclassified as "C" |
| **B211B/B211C** | **C1/C3** | Other single-entry visit visas | Reclassified |
| **D212** | **D1** | Tourist Multiple-Entry Visa | Removed "2" suffix |
| **D212** | **D2** | Business Multiple-Entry Visa | Split from D212 |
| **C312** | **C312** | Work Permit KITAS | ✅ NO CHANGE |
| **C313** | **C313** | Investment KITAS | ✅ NO CHANGE |
| **E33F** | **E33F** | Retirement KITAS | ✅ NO CHANGE |

---

### **Important Notes**

1. **KITAS codes UNCHANGED**: C312 (work), C313 (investment), C314 (family), C315 (student), C316 (religious), E33F/E33E (retirement) remain the same.

2. **Visitor visa codes CHANGED**: Most "B" prefix visas (B211A, B211B, etc.) now have "C" or "211" designation.

3. **Multiple-entry split**: D212 split into D1 (tourist) and D2 (business) for clarity.

4. **Application platform**: All visa applications now MUST be submitted through https://evisa.imigrasi.go.id (no more offline embassy applications for most visa types).

5. **Embassy communication**: Some embassies/consulates still use old index names (B211A), but the e-Visa system uses new indexes (211A/C2). Both are valid references.

---

### **Common Confusion - B211A vs 211A vs C211A**

**Q**: Are B211A, 211A, and C211A the same visa?

**A**:
- **B211A** (old name, pre-2024) = Tourist Visit Visa (60 days + extendable)
- **211A** (new name, 2024+) = Same visa, new index
- **C211A** = Common shorthand used by visa agencies (NOT official index, but widely understood)

**Official Name (2025)**: **211A** (Tourist Visit Visa, Single Entry)

**Recommendation**: When applying online at evisa.imigrasi.go.id, use **211A**. If talking to visa agent, "B211A" or "C211A" will be understood.

## 💍 Marriage to Indonesian Citizen {#marriage-indonesian-citizen}

### **Marriage Registration**

---

**If Married in Indonesia**:

---

### **Post-Nuptial Agreement (Legal Since 2016)**

---

### **Telex Process**

```
Step 1: Sponsor applies for telex approval (in Indonesia)
         ├─ Submit to Directorate General of Immigration (Jakarta)
         ├─ OR via provincial immigration office
         └─ Timeline: 10-14 business days

Step 2: Immigration HQ reviews application
         ├─ Check sponsor credentials
         ├─ Verify supporting documents
         └─ Issue telex to designated embassy

Step 3: Telex sent to specified embassy
         ├─ Via secure telex system
         └─ Telex valid: 90 days from issuance

Step 4: Foreigner applies for VITAS at embassy
         ├─ Show telex approval number
         ├─ Submit documents
         ├─ Pay VITAS fee (USD 50-110)
         └─ Timeline: 3-5 business days (embassy processing)

         └─ Must enter within 90 days of VITAS issuance

Step 6: Convert VITAS → ITAS within 30 days
         └─ At immigration office in Indonesia
```

**Total Timeline**: 3-4 weeks (10 days telex + 5 days embassy + 7 days conversion)

---

### **Documents for Telex Application**

**Required**:
1. Sponsor letter (company OR individual)
2. Sponsor documents (NIB, KTP, etc.)
3. Foreigner's passport copy
4. Passport photo (white background)
5. **Specific to visa type**:
   - C312 (work): RPTKA, DKP-TKA payment proof, employment contract
   - C313 (investment): PT PMA deed, NIB, investment proof
   - E33F (retirement): Pension proof, bank statement

**Submission**: Sponsor submits to immigration (NOT foreigner)

---

### **Emergency Telex / Urgent Cases**

**Q**: Can telex be expedited for family emergency or urgent work need?

**A**: ⚠️ **Limited Options**

**Standard Telex**: 10-14 business days (CANNOT be expedited)

**Alternatives for Urgent Cases**:
1. **VOA** (if urgent entry needed): Enter on VOA (30 days), then apply for KITAS conversion onshore (may require leaving Indonesia after telex approved)
   - ⚠️ NOT recommended (immigration may reject conversion)
2. **Contact immigration directly**: Call Directorate General of Immigration hotline (+62 21 526-5051) or WhatsApp (0821-1430-9957) to request urgent processing
   - Success rate: ~20% (usually only for government officials, diplomats)
3. **Use visa agent**: Some agents have connections for "fast-track" telex (3-5 days instead of 10)
   - Cost: +50-100% fee (IDR 5M-10M extra)
   - Not guaranteed

**Recommendation**: Apply telex **4-6 weeks before** intended travel date (allows buffer for delays)

---

### **Telex Validity**

**Telex Approval**: Valid **90 days** from issuance
**VITAS Issuance** (at embassy): Must apply within 90 days of telex approval
**VITAS Usage**: Must enter Indonesia within **90 days** of VITAS issuance

- Jan 1: Telex approved
- Mar 1: Deadline to apply for VITAS at embassy (90 days from telex)
- Mar 5: VITAS issued by embassy
- Jun 3: Deadline to enter Indonesia (90 days from VITAS)

**⚠️ Critical**:
- If miss any deadline: Telex expires → must reapply (pay fees again, wait 10-14 days again)

---

## 🔄 Re-Entry Permits (MERP/IMK) {#re-entry-permits}

### **Overview**

**MERP** (Multiple Exit Re-Entry Permit) = Izin Masuk Kembali (IMK) = Permission for KITAS/KITAP holders to leave and re-enter Indonesia without losing residence status.

**Old System** (pre-Sep 2024): Separate IMK document required
**New System** (Sep 19, 2024+): Re-entry permit **integrated** into KITAS/KITAP (no separate document needed)

---

### **2024 Law Change - Simplified Re-Entry**

**UU 63/2024** (Effective Sep 19, 2024):
> "Re-entry permits have the same validity period as ITAS/ITAP"

**What This Means**:
- KITAS holders: Re-entry permit valid for **same duration** as KITAS (e.g., 1 year KITAS = 1 year automatic re-entry)
- KITAP holders: Re-entry permit valid for **5 years** (same as KITAP)
- NO separate IMK/MERP application needed (automatic with KITAS/KITAP)

**⚠️ Transition Period (2024-2025)**:
- KITAS issued **before** Sep 19, 2024: May still require separate IMK (check with immigration)
- KITAS issued **after** Sep 19, 2024: Automatic re-entry included

---

### **How to Check if You Need Separate IMK**

**Option 1**: Check KITAS card
- If KITAS issued after Sep 19, 2024 → NO IMK needed (automatic re-entry)
- If KITAS issued before Sep 19, 2024 → May need IMK (verify at immigration office)

**Option 2**: Ask immigration office
- Call immigration hotline: 1500-746
- OR WhatsApp: 0821-1430-9957
- Provide KITAS number → They confirm if IMK needed

---

### **If You Still Need Separate IMK (Pre-2024 KITAS)**

**Application**:
1. Visit immigration office (wilayah kerja = residence area)
2. Bring:
   - Original KITAS/KITAP
   - Passport
   - Sponsor letter (requesting IMK for [name])
   - Sponsor documents (KTP, NPWP, etc.)
   - Passport photos (2 photos, red background, 4×6 cm)
3. Pay fee (see table below)
4. Receive IMK stamp in passport

**Processing**: 3-5 business days

---

### **IMK Fees (If Separate Application Needed)**

| Duration | KITAS (ITAS) Fee | KITAP (ITAP) Fee | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| **6 months** | IDR 1,000,000 (USD 70) | IDR 1,500,000 (USD 100) | Half-year |
| **1 year** | IDR 2,000,000 (USD 140) | IDR 3,000,000 (USD 200) | Most common |
| **2 years** | IDR 4,000,000 (USD 270) | IDR 6,000,000 (USD 400) | For 2-year KITAS (C313) |
| **5 years** | N/A | IDR 10,000,000 (USD 660) | KITAP only |

**⚠️ Note**: Fees vary by KITAS type. Family Reunion KITAP (E31) with Indonesian spouse can only get IMK for 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years (NOT 5 years).

---

### **What Happens if You Leave Indonesia Without Re-Entry Permit?**

**Scenario**: KITAS holder leaves Indonesia without valid re-entry permit (IMK/MERP)

**Consequence**:
1. ❌ **KITAS CANCELED** automatically upon exit
2. Cannot re-enter Indonesia on that KITAS
3. Must apply for **new KITAS** from scratch (telex, VITAS, fees, 4-6 weeks)

**Example Case**:
- Expat with C312 Work KITAS (no IMK)
- Emergency: Had to leave Indonesia due to family death
- At airport departure: Immigration officer canceled KITAS
- Result: Had to apply for new KITAS from home country (lost 4 weeks + USD 1,500 fees)

**⚠️ Critical**: ALWAYS check IMK validity before leaving Indonesia

---

## 🚪 Exit Permit Only (EPO) {#exit-permit-epo}

### **What is EPO?**

**EPO** (Exit Permit Only) = **Izin Keluar** = Permission for KITAS/KITAP holder to leave Indonesia **permanently** (not returning).

**Purpose**: Officially close/cancel KITAS before leaving Indonesia for good.

---

### **When EPO is Required**

| Situation | EPO Required? |
|-----------|---------------|
| Foreigner resigned job (C312 Work KITAS) | ✅ YES |
| Foreigner closing business (C313 Investment KITAS) | ✅ YES |
| Foreigner divorced Indonesian spouse (E31A Spouse KITAS) | ✅ YES |
| Foreigner finished studies (C315 Student KITAS) | ✅ YES |
| Foreigner leaving Indonesia permanently (any KITAS/KITAP) | ✅ YES |
| Foreigner converting KITAS type (e.g., C312 → E33F) | ✅ YES (cancel old, apply new) |

---

### **EPO Application Process**

**Step 1: Submit EPO Application**

**Documents**:
1. Original passport
2. Original KITAS/KITAP card
3. e-KITAS printout
4. Sponsor application letter:
   ```
   We hereby request cancellation of [foreigner name]'s KITAS [number]
   due to [reason: resignation/end of contract/etc.].
   [Foreigner name] will leave Indonesia on [date].
   ```
5. Copy of sponsor's e-KTP (Indonesian ID)
6. **For Work KITAS**: Copy of DPKK (employment registry) + IMTA
7. **For Spouse KITAS**: Marriage certificate
8. Departure ticket (proof of exit date)

**Submission**: Immigration office (wilayah kerja = residence area)

---

**Step 2: Immigration Reviews**

- Processing: **3-5 business days**
- Immigration verifies:
  - No outstanding violations
  - No overstay penalties owed
  - Sponsor confirms foreigner leaving

---

**Step 3: EPO Stamp in Passport**

- Immigration stamps passport: "EXIT PERMIT ONLY - Valid until [date]"
- Validity: **7 days** from stamp date
- **MUST leave Indonesia within 7 days** after receiving EPO stamp

---

**Step 4: Exit Indonesia**

- At airport: Immigration checks EPO stamp
- KITAS officially canceled upon departure
- Cannot re-enter on that KITAS

**Fee**: IDR 100,000 (USD 7) - Surat Tanda Melapor (STM) cancellation fee

---

### **Consequences of Leaving WITHOUT EPO**

**If KITAS holder leaves Indonesia permanently without EPO**:

1. **KITAS remains "active" in system** (not officially canceled)
2. **Sponsor remains liable** (must pay annual fees, report to immigration)
3. **Re-entry issues**: If try to return to Indonesia on tourist visa → Immigration may question "Why didn't you cancel KITAS?"
4. **Interrogation risk**: May be summoned for questioning
5. **Entry denial risk**: Immigration may refuse entry at discretion

**Example Case** (2024):
- Australian expat quit job in Bali, left on C312 Work KITAS without EPO
- 6 months later: Tried to return on VOA for vacation
- At airport: Immigration flagged "You have active KITAS, why didn't you cancel?"
- Interrogated 2 hours, eventually allowed entry (warning issued)
- Advised: "Cancel KITAS remotely via TSP procedure or you may be denied entry next time"

---

### **Alternative: TSP/ERP/ETK (Remote KITAS Cancellation)**

**If Already Outside Indonesia Without EPO**:

Can cancel KITAS remotely via **TSP (Temporary Stay Permit) cancellation procedure**:

1. Sponsor submits cancellation request to immigration (in Indonesia)
2. Immigration processes remotely
3. KITAS canceled in system
4. Processing: 2-4 weeks
5. Fee: IDR 500,000-1,000,000 (USD 35-70)

**⚠️ Note**: TSP cancellation may still result in entry watch (tanda pengawasan) if immigration suspects improper exit.

---

- Jakarta → USA: USD 1,500-3,000
- Jakarta → Australia: USD 800-1,500
