## 💡 Practical Guide for Bali Businesses

### **Step-by-Step: Choosing KBLI Code**

**Step 1: Define Business Activities**

**Step 2: Research Codes**
- Use OSS Sabaku search: https://oss.go.id

**Step 3: Check Restrictions**
- Cross-reference with DNI (Positive Investment List)
- Verify foreign ownership allowed

- Green/yellow zones often restrict commercial activities

**Step 5: Calculate Total Capital**

- Total = codes × locations × IDR 10B

**Step 6: Consult Expert**

### **Bali-Specific Considerations**

- More government offices accessible

**Gianyar Regency** (Ubud):
- Cultural preservation focus
- Some restrictions on commercial activities
- Tourism licenses prioritized

**Tabanan Regency** (Tanah Lot):
- Agricultural land restrictions
- Coastal area limitations
- Tourism development encouraged in specific zones

**Buleleng Regency** (North Bali):
