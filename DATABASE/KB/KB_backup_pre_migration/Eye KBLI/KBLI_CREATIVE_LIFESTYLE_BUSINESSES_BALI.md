## 📊 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS COMPARISON

### **Standard PT PMA** (Most Sectors)
```
Total Investment: IDR 10,000,000,000 per KBLI per location
Paid-Up Capital: IDR 2,500,000,000 (25%)
```

### **E-Commerce Exception**
```
100% Foreign: Requires IDR 100,000,000,000 (USD ~7M)
Below IDR 100B: Must be local company (0% foreign)
```

### **Wholesale (46xxx) - Per 4 Digits**
```
Investment per FIRST 4 digits of KBLI
Example: 46201, 46202, 46203 → One IDR 10B for all "4620x" codes
```

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS FOR CREATIVE/LIFESTYLE BUSINESSES

### **1. E-Commerce Capital Trap**
- Most clients think: "E-commerce = IDR 10B like other businesses"
- ❌ **WRONG**: E-commerce requires **IDR 100B** for foreign ownership
- Below IDR 100B = Must be local company

**Solution**: Use KBLI 46xxx (wholesale) for B2B sales instead of B2C retail

---

### **2. Retail = Closed to Foreigners**
**All KBLI 47xxx codes** (retail) are generally **CLOSED** to foreign investors:
- 47711 (Clothing boutiques)
- 47221 (Alcohol retail)
- 47111 (Supermarkets)
- 47919 (E-commerce < IDR 100B)

**Only Option**: Local PT (Indonesian-owned)

---

### **3. Cannot Combine Retail + Manufacturing**
**Common Mistake**: "I'll make clothes and sell them in my shop"

**Reality**:
- Manufacturing (14xxx) = Separate PT
- Retail (47xxx) = Separate PT (local only)
- **Cannot** combine under one entity

---

### **4. Coworking = Real Estate Code**
- No specific KBLI for "coworking"
- Use **KBLI 68110** (real estate rental)
- If adding services (VO, events), add those KBLI codes
- Each additional KBLI = +IDR 10B investment

---

### **5. Education Sector Restrictions**
- **Childcare, schools** (85xxx) have special regulations
- Foreign ownership **restricted** or requires cooperation with Indonesian institution
- **Verify** current rules before proceeding
- Law 20/2003 governs education sector

---

### **6. Photography Includes Video**
- **KBLI 74201** covers BOTH photography AND videography
- No separate videography code needed
- Saves IDR 10B investment (one code, not two)

---

### **7. Low-Risk = NIB Sufficient**
Many creative/lifestyle businesses are **low-risk**:
- 73100 (Advertising)
- 74201 (Photography)
- 93116 (Fitness)
- 96011 (Laundry)

**Benefit**: NIB alone = can operate (no additional licenses)

---

### **8. Wholesale vs Retail - The Loophole**
If sector is **closed for retail** but **open for wholesale**:

**Strategy**: Operate as wholesale (KBLI 46xxx)
- Sell to other businesses (B2B)
- Sell in bulk/wholesale quantities
- NOT direct to end consumers (B2C)

**Example**: Cannot retail clothes? Wholesale them instead (46xxx).

---
