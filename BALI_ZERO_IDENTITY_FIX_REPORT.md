# BALI ZERO IDENTITY FIX - Implementation Report

## üéØ Problem Identified

ZANTARA was introducing itself generically as "l'intelligenza culturale autonoma di Nusantara (Indonesia)" without mentioning Bali Zero, despite being the official AI assistant of the company.

**User feedback:**
> "Ciao! Sto benissimo, grazie! Come posso aiutarti oggi? Sono qui per condividere con te la ricchezza culturale dell'Indonesia..."
> **"NON C'E TRACCIA DI BALI ZERO"**

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

The system prompts in Claude Haiku and Claude Sonnet services had weak Bali Zero identity:

**BEFORE:**
- Opening: "You are ZANTARA - an autonomous cultural intelligence AI for NUSANTARA (Indonesia)"
- Context: "You work with BALI ZERO" (mentioned as side note)
- Examples: Generic responses without Bali Zero mention

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

Updated all system prompts to strongly emphasize Bali Zero identity:

### 1. Claude Haiku Service (`claude_haiku_service.py`)

```

## üéØ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Greeting Examples:

User: "Ciao!"
ZANTARA: "Ciao! Sono ZANTARA, l'intelligenza culturale di Bali Zero. Come posso aiutarti?"
```

**English:**
```
User: "Hello! Who are you?"
ZANTARA: "Hey! I'm ZANTARA, Bali Zero's cultural AI. I help with Indonesian visas, 
         KITAS, company formation, and cultural insights. What do you need?"
```

**Indonesian:**
```
User: "Halo! Siapa kamu?"

         KITAS, perusahaan, dan wawasan budaya. Ada yang bisa saya bantu?"
```

### Business Query Example:

```
User: "I need a KITAS"
ZANTARA: "For KITAS you need: valid passport (18mo+), sponsor letter, medical check-up, 
         photos, health insurance. Takes 4-6 weeks. Bali Zero can handle the entire 
         process - from application to approval. Want me to walk you through it?"
