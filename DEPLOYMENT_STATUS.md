## ⏳ Pending Steps

### 4. Railway Build (In Progress)
Railway will automatically:
1. 🔄 Detect new commit on `main` branch
2. 🔄 Start build process
3. 🔄 Install dependencies (`npm install`)
4. 🔄 Build TypeScript (`npm run build`)
5. 🔄 Deploy to production
6. 🔄 Restart service

**Estimated Time:** 3-5 minutes

### 5. Environment Variable (Action Required) ⚠️
**CRITICAL:** You must add the API key to Railway:

```bash
# Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard
open https://railway.app/dashboard

# Step 2: Select your project/service

# Step 3: Go to Settings → Variables

# Step 4: Add new variable
Variable Name: IMAGINEART_API_KEY
Variable Value: your_api_key_from_imagine.art
```

**Without this, the handlers will fail with:**
```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "IMAGINEART_API_KEY not configured"
}
```

### 6. Production Testing (After Deploy)
Once Railway finishes deploying:

```bash
# Get your Railway production URL
RAILWAY_URL="https://your-app.railway.app"

# Test 1: Connection Test
curl -X POST "$RAILWAY_URL/call" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: zantara-internal-dev-key-2025" \
  -d '{"key":"ai-services.image.test"}' | jq '.'

# Expected response:
# {
#   "ok": true,
#   "data": {
#     "available": true,
#     "provider": "Imagine.art",
#     "timestamp": "2025-10-16T..."
#   }
# }

# Test 2: Generate Image
curl -X POST "$RAILWAY_URL/call" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: zantara-internal-dev-key-2025" \
  -d '{
    "key": "ai-services.image.generate",
    "params": {
      "prompt": "Beautiful Bali sunset",
      "style": "realistic",
      "aspect_ratio": "16:9"
    }
  }' | jq -r '.data.image_url[:100]'

# Expected response:
# data:image/png;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRg...
```

## 📊 Deployment Checklist

- [x] Code implemented and tested locally
- [x] Files committed to git
- [x] Changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Railway build completed
- [ ] Environment variable added (`IMAGINEART_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Production testing passed
- [ ] Monitoring configured (optional)

---

## 🔍 How to Monitor Deployment

### Option 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)
```bash
# Open Railway dashboard in browser
open https://railway.app/dashboard
```

**What to check:**
- Build logs (should show TypeScript compilation)
- Deploy status (should show "Active" with green dot)
- Recent logs (should show server starting on port 8080)

### Option 2: Railway CLI
```bash
# View live logs
railway logs

# Check deployment status
railway status

# List services
railway service
```

### Option 3: Health Check
```bash
# Once deployed, check if service is responding
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Symptoms:** Railway shows "Build Failed"

**Solutions:**
1. Check build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify TypeScript compiles locally: `npm run build`
3. Check for missing dependencies
4. Verify `tsconfig.json` is correct

### Issue 2: Handler Not Found
**Symptoms:** 
```json
{"ok": false, "error": "handler_not_found"}
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify handler key is exactly: `ai-services.image.generate`
2. Check server logs for handler registration
3. Ensure files are deployed (check Railway files tab)

### Issue 3: API Key Error
**Symptoms:**
```json
{"ok": false, "error": "IMAGINEART_API_KEY not configured"}
```

**Solution:**
1. Add environment variable in Railway dashboard
2. Redeploy service after adding variable
3. Verify variable is set: `railway variables`

### Issue 4: Timeout
**Symptoms:** Request times out after 60s

**Solutions:**
1. Check Imagine.art API status
2. Verify API key is valid
3. Try simpler prompt (e.g., "test")
4. Check Railway logs for errors

## 📈 Next Steps After Deployment

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ Add `IMAGINEART_API_KEY` to Railway
2. ✅ Test production endpoints
3. ✅ Verify image generation works
4. ✅ Check response times

### Short Term (This Week)
1. 🔄 Monitor API usage
2. 🔄 Track costs
3. 🔄 Add usage logging
4. 🔄 Consider response caching

### Long Term
1. 🔄 Cloud Storage integration (upload images, return URLs)
2. 🔄 Rate limiting per user
3. 🔄 Multiple provider support (DALL-E, etc.)
4. 🔄 Advanced features (inpainting, variations)
