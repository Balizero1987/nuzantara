# GDPR and Privacy Operations

## Core Principles
- Apply data minimisation, purpose limitation, and storage limitation per GDPR Article 5.
- Assign a lawful basis (consent, contract, legitimate interest, etc.) for every processing activity (Article 6).
- When relying on providers such as Meta (Cloud API), execute data processing agreements (Article 28) and Standard Contractual Clauses 2021/914 for international transfers.

## Cloud API Considerations
- Cloud API stores messages encrypted at rest for up to 30 days to enable retransmission; describe this retention in your Record of Processing Activities and customer-facing privacy notices.
- Document data flows involving WhatsApp, including the location of Meta's infrastructure and any sub-processors.
- Provide data subject rights workflows (access, deletion, rectification) covering WhatsApp interactions.
