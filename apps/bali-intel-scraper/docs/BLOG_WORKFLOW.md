## üìÖ Daily Workflow

### **Step 1: Collaborators Create Article Draft** (11:30 AM, 20 min)

After completing scraping + structuring, collaborators create a blog article:

**1.1 Select Top Story**
- From structured JSON, pick the most important news item
- Criteria: impact_level="critical" or "high", tier="1" or "2"

**1.2 Create Article with Claude/ChatGPT**

**Prompt for AI**:
```
I need to create a blog article from this news item:

Title: [title from JSON]
Summary: [summary_english]
Key Changes: [key_changes]
Source: [source] (Tier [tier])
Impact: [impact_level]

Please create a blog article in this format:

---
CATEGORY: [Immigration/Tax/RealEstate/Events/etc]
TITLE: [Catchy, clear title in English]
SUBTITLE: [One-line hook]

ARTICLE BODY (200-300 words):
[Well-structured article with:
- Opening paragraph (what happened)
- Details & context
- Impact on expats
- Action items if needed
- Closing with next steps or timeline]

IMAGE PROMPT:
[A DALL-E/Midjourney prompt for a symbolic image representing this news]
Example: "Modern minimalist illustration of Indonesian visa documents with Bali temple silhouette in background, professional gradient colors, clean design"

SUMMARY FOR SIDEBAR (2 sentences max):
[Short version for blog sidebar preview]

METADATA:
- Tier: [1/2/3]
- Impact: [critical/high/medium/low]
- Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- Source: [source name]
---

Make it professional, clear, and actionable for expats in Bali.
```

**1.3 Generate Image**

Use Claude/ChatGPT to generate image with the IMAGE PROMPT:

**In Claude.ai**:
- Copy the IMAGE PROMPT from article
- Ask: "Generate an image for this: [IMAGE PROMPT]"
- Claude generates AI image
- Download image (right-click ‚Üí Save Image)

**Or use DALL-E (ChatGPT Plus)**:
- Use ChatGPT DALL-E: "/dalle [IMAGE PROMPT]"
- Download generated image

**1.4 Save Files**

Save two files:
- `immigration_blog_YYYYMMDD.md` (article text)
- `immigration_blog_YYYYMMDD.jpg` (image)

Store in: `apps/bali-intel-scraper/data/blog/[topic]/`

---

### **Step 2: Upload to ZANTARA** (11:50 AM, 5 min)

**2.1 Create JSON for ZANTARA**

Convert article to JSON format:

## üìä Output Examples

### **Blog Article Format**:

```markdown
---
CATEGORY: Immigration
TITLE: E28A Processing Time Cut in Half
SUBTITLE: Faster investor visas starting February 2025
---

Indonesia's Ministry of Law and Human Rights (Kemenkumham) announced a significant improvement for foreign investors: E28A Investor Visa processing time will be reduced from 14 to 7 days, effective February 1, 2025.

This change comes as part of the government's ongoing efforts to attract foreign investment and streamline business processes. The E28A visa, designed for foreign investors establishing companies in Indonesia, has been a popular choice for entrepreneurs looking to operate legally in Bali and across the archipelago.

**Impact on Expats**: Current applicants with pending E28A visas can expect faster processing. Those planning to apply should prepare documentation in advance to take advantage of the new timeline.

**Action Required**: No action needed for current visa holders. New applicants should ensure all documents are ready by late January to benefit from the February 1 launch.

**Next Steps**: Kemenkumham will release detailed implementation guidelines by January 20. Monitor official channels for updates.

IMAGE: [Modern illustration of Indonesian visa with Bali background]
SOURCE: Kemenkumham (Tier 1)
IMPACT: High
DEADLINE: 2025-02-01
```

## üñºÔ∏è Image Generation Tips

**Good IMAGE PROMPTs**:
‚úÖ "Modern flat illustration of Indonesian passport with Bali temple silhouette, gradient purple and blue, minimalist professional design"
‚úÖ "Clean vector graphic of tax documents and calculator, with Indonesia flag colors, professional business style"
‚úÖ "Elegant watercolor painting of Bali villa with 'SOLD' sign, warm sunset colors, tropical vibes"

**Bad IMAGE PROMPTs**:
‚ùå "Picture of visa" (too vague)
‚ùå "Complex realistic photo with 10 elements" (too busy)
‚ùå "Dark scary bureaucracy nightmare" (wrong tone)

**Style Guidelines**:
- Modern, clean, professional
- Symbolic, not literal (abstractions > photos)
- Bali/Indonesia themed when relevant
- Optimistic colors (purples, blues, greens)
- Avoid text in images (AI text looks bad)
