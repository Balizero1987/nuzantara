"""
Cultural Knowledge Generator - Create cultural context chunks for Haiku

Generates 10-15 dynamic knowledge chunks about Indonesian business culture
that Haiku can inject into conversations when contextually relevant.

Examples:
- Indonesian greetings and relationship-building
- Bureaucracy navigation and patience
- Face-saving communication patterns
- Bali's Tri Hita Karana philosophy
- Meeting etiquette and hierarchy respect

These are NOT fixed responses - they're contextual knowledge that Haiku
uses to generate natural, culturally-aware responses.
