================================================================================
7. WORK RIGHTS & RESTRICTIONS
================================================================================

ALLOWED:
✅ Manage your PT PMA (Board of Directors, Commissioner role)
✅ Conduct business activities related to investment
✅ Receive salary/dividends from PT PMA
✅ Travel in/out Indonesia freely (multiple entry)
✅ Bring family (E31B Dependent KITAS)
✅ Own property (through PT PMA or personal - see real estate guide)
✅ Open Indonesian bank account (easier approval than E23)

NOT ALLOWED:
❌ Work for OTHER companies (unless you have E23 for that company)
❌ E28A does NOT include work permit (IMTA) for employment
  → If you want to be "employee" of PT PMA (not just investor): Need RPTKA + IMTA
❌ Political activities / media without permit

KEY DIFFERENCE: E28A vs E23
=============================
E28A = INVESTOR status (shareholder/owner)
E23 = EMPLOYEE status (salaried worker)

If you want to be BOTH investor AND employee of your own PT PMA:
- Option A: E28A only (manage as owner/director - no salary, dividends only)
- Option B: E28A + RPTKA/IMTA (be both investor AND employee - can draw salary)
  → IMTA fee: 1,200 USD/year (if you want to be paid employee)

Most investors choose Option A (E28A only, no IMTA) to avoid extra costs.

================================================================================
8. PATH TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY (KITAP)
================================================================================

After holding E28A for 3 consecutive years, you may apply for:

INVESTOR KITAP (Permanent Residence Permit)
- Validity: 5 years (renewable indefinitely)
- Requirements:
  □ 3 years continuous E28A KITAS (no gaps)
  □ Investment still active (10B+ IDR maintained for 3 years)
  □ PT PMA still operational
  □ Tax compliance (3 years SPT filed)
  □ Clean immigration record
  □ Indonesian language proficiency (basic)

Cost: Contact Bali Zero for quote (typically 50-80 million IDR)

Benefits of INVESTOR KITAP:
- No more 2-year renewals (5-year validity)
- Not tied to specific company (can invest in multiple companies)
- Can sell PT PMA shares without losing residency
- Easier to get loans/mortgages
- Family (E31B) also eligible for KITAP

================================================================================
9. COMPARISON: E28A vs E33G (Remote Worker) vs E23 (Work)
================================================================================

CHOOSE E28A INVESTOR KITAS IF:
- You have 10B+ IDR to invest in Indonesian business
- You want to run your own PT PMA
- You want 2-year validity (vs E23's 1 year)
- You want path to permanent residency (KITAP)
- You don't need to be salaried employee

CHOOSE E23 WORKING KITAS IF:
- You're employed by existing company (not your own)
- Company sponsors your permit
- Investment threshold too high (don't have 10B IDR)
- You want salary (not just dividends)

CHOOSE E33G REMOTE WORKER IF:
- You work remotely for foreign company
- You DON'T want to invest in Indonesian business
- Cheapest option (12.5M IDR vs 17M E28A vs 34.5M E23)
- But: No path to KITAP, only 1 year validity

See comparison table:
| Feature           | E28A        | E23         | E33G        |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Validity          | 2 years     | 1 year      | 1 year      |
| Cost (offshore)   | 17M IDR     | 34.5M IDR   | 12.5M IDR   |
| Investment needed | 10B IDR     | None        | None        |
| Work rights       | Own company | Sponsor     | Remote only |
| Path to KITAP     | Yes (3yrs)  | Yes (3yrs)  | No          |

================================================================================
10. COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS
================================================================================

ISSUE: Investment verification failed (OSS shows <10B IDR)
SOLUTION:
- Ensure LKPM filed correctly via OSS portal
- Bank statement must match Akta capital structure
- If capital in stages: Show installment proof + commitment letter
→ Bali Zero can assist with LKPM filing

ISSUE: PT PMA deemed "not operational" by immigration
SOLUTION:
- Provide: Office lease, employee payroll records, business contracts
- Financial statements (even if zero revenue, show expenses = operational)
- Business plan for new PT PMA (if <6 months old)

ISSUE: Can I use property purchase as "investment"?
SOLUTION:
- Personal villa/house: NO (doesn't count toward 10B threshold)
- Commercial property via PT PMA: YES (if part of business plan)
→ E28A is for BUSINESS investment, not personal asset holding

ISSUE: E28A rejected because sector is in DNI (Negative List)
SOLUTION:
- Check DNI 2021 (latest): Some sectors closed/restricted to foreign investment
- Restricted: Retail <200 sqm, small-scale agriculture, certain consultancy
- If rejected: Change business sector in NIB/Akta before reapplying

ISSUE: Need to reduce capital below 10B IDR
SOLUTION:
- E28A becomes invalid if capital drops <10B
- Must maintain threshold for entire KITAS validity
- If need to divest: Exit Indonesia or convert to different visa (E23/E33G)

================================================================================
11. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Can I apply E28A if I own 10% of PT PMA worth 100B IDR?
A: Yes! It's your personal investment amount that matters. 10% of 100B = 10B.

Q: Can husband and wife both get E28A from same PT PMA?
A: Yes, if EACH person's investment ≥10B (total 20B+ in company).

Q: Does E28A allow me to work for my own company?
A: You can manage/direct as owner (BOD/BOC). For salaried employment: Need RPTKA+IMTA.

Q: Can I invest in multiple PT PMAs and get multiple E28A?
A: No. E28A is per person, not per company. But you can invest in multiple 
companies under one E28A (total investment >10B).

Q: What happens if PT PMA goes bankrupt?
A: E28A becomes invalid. You have 60 days to either:
1. Invest in new PT PMA (10B+ IDR) + apply new E28A, or
2. Exit Indonesia

Q: Can I sell my PT PMA shares while on E28A?
A: Partial sale OK if you maintain 10B+ investment. Full sale = lose E28A.

Q: Do I pay Indonesian tax with E28A?
A: Yes. PT PMA pays corporate tax (22%). Personal tax:
- Dividends: 10% withholding tax (if foreign shareholder)
- If stay >183 days/year: File personal SPT (tax resident)

Q: Can I convert E23 (work) to E28A (investor)?
A: Yes! If you invest 10B+ in PT PMA, apply for E28A onshore conversion.
