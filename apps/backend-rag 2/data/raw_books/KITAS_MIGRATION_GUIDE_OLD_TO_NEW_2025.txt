MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------
If you currently hold C314:

Option A: Upgrade to E28A (if investment ‚â•10B IDR)
---------------------------------------------------
1. Verify your PT PMA has 10B+ IDR paid-up capital
   - If <10B: Need to inject additional capital
   - Update Akta Pendirian (Deed) if needed

2. File LKPM (Investment Activity Report) via OSS
   - Show investment realization (bank statement proof)

3. Apply E28A (cannot "extend" C314, must apply new E28A)
   - Cost: 17M IDR (vs old C314 extension 25M)
   - Duration: 2 years (vs old 1 year)

Option B: Downgrade to E23 (if investment <10B IDR)
-----------------------------------------------------
If your investment is below 10B threshold:

2. Options:
   A. Increase capital to 10B+ ‚Üí E28A
   B. Become employee of your PT PMA ‚Üí E23 Working KITAS
      - Company sponsors your E23

See: E28A_INVESTOR_KITAS_GUIDE_2025.txt for full details

---

2.3 C313 ‚Üí E31 FAMILY/DEPENDENT KITAS
=======================================

WHAT CHANGED:
-------------
OLD SYSTEM (C313):
- Generic "family visa"
- All family types under one code
- Validity: 1 year only
- Cost: ~9,000,000 IDR
- Work rights: Ambiguous (case-by-case)

NEW SYSTEM (E31A/B/C/D/E):
- 5 distinct subcategories:
  * E31A: Spouse of Indonesian citizen
  * E31B: Dependent of foreigner (KITAS/KITAP holder)
  * E31C: Child of Indonesian citizen
  * E31D: Parent of Indonesian citizen
  * E31E: Extended family of KITAS holder
  
- Validity: 1, 2, 5, or 10 years (depends on subcategory)
- Cost: 11M (1yr) or 15M (2yr) for E31A/B
- Work rights: CLARIFIED
  * E31A: CAN apply for work permit (RPTKA+IMTA)
  * E31B/C/D/E: CANNOT work

MIGRATION INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------
If you currently hold C313:

Step 1: Identify which E31 subcategory applies
------------------------------------------------

Am I married to Indonesian citizen?
‚Üí E31A (Spouse of Indonesian)

Am I spouse/child of foreigner with KITAS (E23/E28A/E33)?
‚Üí E31B (Dependent of Foreigner)

Am I child (under 18) of Indonesian citizen?
‚Üí E31C (Child of Indonesian)

Am I parent of Indonesian citizen?
‚Üí E31D (Parent of Indonesian)

Am I other family (sibling, in-law, etc.) of KITAS holder?
‚Üí E31E (Extended Family)

Step 2: Gather new documents (vs old C313)
--------------------------------------------
Old C313 was lenient on docs. New E31 requires:

For E31A (Spouse of Indonesian):
- Marriage certificate registered with Indonesian Civil Registry (Catatan Sipil)
  * Old C313: Embassy legalization sometimes enough
  * New E31A: MUST register with Catatan Sipil in Indonesia
- KK (Family Card) with spouse listed
- Indonesian spouse's income proof (min 3x UMK)

For E31B (Dependent of Foreigner):
- Sponsor's KITAS must have >6 months validity
  * Old C313: Could apply even if sponsor's visa expiring soon
  * New E31B: Strict ">6 months" rule

Step 3: Apply for appropriate E31 subcategory
----------------------------------------------
Cannot "extend" C313 (code abolished). Must apply NEW E31.

Cost comparison:
- Old C313: ~9M IDR/year
- New E31A/B (1 year): 11M IDR (slight increase)
- New E31A/B (2 years): 15M IDR (saves 5M over 2x 1-year)

ADVANTAGE: If you want to work (and have E31A):
- Old C313: Work permit unclear (often rejected)
- New E31A: Can apply for RPTKA + IMTA (clear path to employment)

PATH: 
- E31A ‚Üí Family KITAP (after several years)
- E31B ‚Üí Sponsor gets KITAP ‚Üí E31B converts to KITAP Dependent

See: E31_FAMILY_DEPENDENT_KITAS_GUIDE_2025.txt for full details

================================================================================
3. NEW CATEGORIES (No Old Equivalent)
================================================================================

3.1 E33F RETIREMENT KITAS
==========================

DID NOT EXIST IN OLD SYSTEM
------------------------------
Old "retirement visa" was informal arrangement (often C1 tourist extended repeatedly).

NEW E33F (2024):
- Official retirement permit (not tourist visa abuse)
- Age 55+ required
- Financial: USD 1,500/month pension OR USD 35K bank deposit
- Validity: 1 year or 5 years
- Cost: 14M IDR (1yr offshore)
- Work rights: CANNOT work (strictly retirement)
- Path to KITAP: Yes (after 4 years)

WHO SHOULD APPLY:
- Retirees aged 55+ who previously used serial C1 extensions
- Former E23 holders who retired (and are 55+)
- Foreigners with pension income wanting long-term stay

See: E33_RETIREMENT_REMOTE_KITAS_GUIDE_2025.txt for full details

---

3.2 E33G REMOTE WORKER / DIGITAL NOMAD KITAS
==============================================

BRAND NEW 2024 - INDONESIA'S "DIGITAL NOMAD VISA"
--------------------------------------------------
No equivalent in old system. Previously, digital nomads either:
- Abused tourist visa (illegal if earning income)
- Got E23 via shell company (expensive, legally dubious)

NEW E33G (2024):
- Official remote worker permit
- Income: USD 2,000/month (from foreign company/clients)
- Validity: 1 year (renewable)
- Cost: 12,500,000 IDR (cheapest work-related KITAS!)
- Work rights: Remote work for foreign entities ONLY
- NO path to KITAP (but can renew indefinitely)

WHO SHOULD APPLY:
- Freelancers/contractors working for foreign clients
- Remote employees of foreign companies
- Online business owners serving foreign markets
- Digital nomads currently on tourist visa (upgrade to legal status)

ADVANTAGE over old "fake E23" scheme:
- E33G: 12.5M IDR, no company needed, honest application
- Fake E23: 34.5M + shell company costs (20M+) + legal risk

See: E33_RETIREMENT_REMOTE_KITAS_GUIDE_2025.txt for full details

================================================================================
4. TRANSITION TIMELINE & GRACE PERIODS
================================================================================

CRITICAL DATES:
---------------
- 2023-06: C312/C313/C314 codes officially abolished
- 2023-07 to 2024-12: Grace period (could still extend old visas)
- 2025-01-01: Grace period ENDED
  * All C312/C313/C314 extensions now rejected
  * Must apply for E-series equivalents

IF YOU STILL HOLD C312/C313/C314 IN 2025:
------------------------------------------
1. Check expiry date
2. If <30 days remaining: URGENT - apply E-series now
3. If 1-3 months: Start E-series application (don't wait)
4. If >3 months: Plan transition (gather E-series requirements)

CANNOT EXTEND OLD C-SERIES:
- Immigration will reject extension requests
- Only option: Apply new E-series KITAS

ONSHORE CONVERSION ALLOWED:
- Can convert C312‚ÜíE23, C314‚ÜíE28A, C313‚ÜíE31 while in Indonesia
- Costs slightly more (onshore pricing)
- But avoids need to exit & re-enter

================================================================================
5. COST COMPARISON: OLD vs NEW SYSTEM
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: Work Permit (Manager Level)
-----------------------------------------
OLD C312A (1 year): 30M IDR
NEW E23 (1 year): 34.5M IDR
Difference: +4.5M IDR/year (15% increase)
Reason: BPJS insurance mandatory (adds ~3M/year)

VERDICT: Slightly more expensive, but better benefits (health insurance included)

---

SCENARIO 2: Investor Permit
-----------------------------
OLD C314 (2 years): 25M + 25M = 50M IDR
NEW E28A (2 years): 17M IDR
Difference: -33M IDR over 2 years (66% cheaper!)
Reason: Higher investment threshold (10B vs 2.5B) but longer validity

VERDICT: Much cheaper IF you meet 10B IDR investment threshold

---

SCENARIO 3: Family Dependent (2 years)
----------------------------------------
OLD C313 (2 years): 9M + 9M = 18M IDR
NEW E31A/B (2 years): 15M IDR
Difference: -3M IDR (17% cheaper)
Reason: 2-year option introduced (wasn't available in C313)

VERDICT: Cheaper if you choose 2-year validity upfront

---

SCENARIO 4: Digital Nomad (NEW!)
----------------------------------
OLD System: No legal option (used tourist visa illegally or fake E23 ~54M+/year)
NEW E33G (1 year): 12.5M IDR
Difference: -41.5M IDR/year (vs fake E23 route)

VERDICT: Huge savings + legal compliance!

================================================================================
6. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: I have C312A expiring in 2 months. Can I "extend" to C312B instead of E23?
A: No. C312A/B codes are abolished. Cannot extend to either. Must apply E23.

Q: I held C314 for 5 years. Do I qualify for KITAP?
A: No. C314 years don't count toward KITAP (old system). KITAP requires 3 years 
   continuous E28A (new system). Your C314 years = "reset" to zero on E28A.

Q: Can I downgrade from E28A (10B investment) back to C314 (2.5B threshold)?
A: No. C314 doesn't exist anymore. If you reduce investment below 10B, you lose 
   E28A eligibility. Options: Inject capital to maintain 10B, or switch to E23.

Q: I'm on C313 (family visa) and want to work. Should I convert to E31A?
A: Only if married to Indonesian citizen ‚Üí E31A (can get work permit).
   If dependent of foreigner ‚Üí E31B (cannot work, must get separate E23).

Q: My C312A says "1 year validity" but I've extended it 10 times. Does that count?
A: No. Each C312 was a separate 1-year permit. KITAP requires 3 CONSECUTIVE 
   years of E23 (new system). Your C312 history doesn't transfer.

Q: I'm 54 years old, can I get E33F Retirement KITAS now?
A: No. E33F requires age 55+. Wait until your 55th birthday, then apply.
   Alternative: E33G Remote Worker (if working) or C1/D1 tourist visa until 55.

Q: Can I convert from E23 (work) to E33G (remote worker) if I want to freelance?
A: Yes, but only if:
   1. You quit your Indonesian company job (E23 becomes invalid)
   2. You have foreign clients/income (not Indonesian)
   3. You meet E33G requirements (USD 2K/month income)
   Otherwise: Stay on E23 (safer path to KITAP)

Q: I'm on E33G. Can I later "upgrade" to E28A if I invest 10B in PT PMA?
A: Yes! Apply for E28A onshore conversion (19M IDR). But note: E33G years don't 
   count toward KITAP. KITAP clock starts when you get E28A (3-year countdown).
