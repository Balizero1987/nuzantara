### What is KITAS?

KITAS, or Kartu Izin Tinggal Terbatas (Temporary Stay Permit Card), is a permit that allows foreign nationals to reside in Indonesia for a specific period. It is typically issued for various purposes, including work, family reunification, or study.

Key characteristics of KITAS include:
*   **Validity**: KITAS can be valid for 1 year or 2 years, and is generally renewable annually (Document 1, Document 2, Document 5).
*   **Sponsorship**: Obtaining a KITAS requires a sponsor, which can be an employer, an educational institution, or an Indonesian spouse (Document 2, Document 4, Document 5).
*   **Work Eligibility**:
    *   For work-related KITAS, an IMTA (work permit notification) is issued automatically after KITAS approval (Document 3).
    *   A Family KITAS, sponsored by an Indonesian spouse, explicitly states that the holder **CANNOT** work in Indonesia (Document 5).

### How to Obtain a KITAS

The process of obtaining a KITAS involves an initial application, often as a conversion from a VITAS (Visa Izin Tinggal Terbatas), and subsequent extensions.

#### 1. Initial Application (Conversion from VITAS)

Foreign nationals typically apply for a KITAS at the local immigration office within 7 days of their arrival in Indonesia, after entering with a VITAS (Document 4).

*   Sponsor guarantee letter (Document 4)
*   All original supporting documents (e.g., marriage certificate, birth certificate, etc.) (Document 4)
*   BPJS registration proof (if KITAS validity is more than 6 months) (Document 4)
*   Address registration (e.g., landlord letter, rental contract) (Document 4)
*   For work-related KITAS, RPTKA (Rencana Penggunaan Tenaga Kerja Asing) and NIB (Nomor Induk Berusaha) documents are also required (Document 3).

**Fees and Processing Time:**
*   **Fee**: IDR 3,500,000 - 5,000,000, depending on the duration (Document 4).
*   **Processing Time**: 3-5 business days (Document 4).

**Specifics for Family KITAS:**
*   **Sponsor**: Indonesian spouse (citizen) (Document 5).
*   **Validity**: 1-2 years, renewable (Document 5).

*   **Timeline**: 3-6 weeks (Document 5).
*   **Requirements**: Legalized marriage certificate, spouse's KTP (Indonesian ID card), and proof of relationship (Document 5).

#### 2. KITAS Extension

KITAS holders must apply for an extension before their current permit expires.

**Application Timeline:**
*   Apply 30 days before the expiry date of the current KITAS (Document 1, Document 2",0.8947368421052632,0.8515423913009891
