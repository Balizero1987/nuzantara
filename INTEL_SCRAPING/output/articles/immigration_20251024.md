## Article 5: Indonesia - The Jakarta Post {#article-5}
**Original Publication**: None
**Source**: [Jakarta Post - Indonesia News](https://www.thejakartapost.com/indonesia)
**Scraped**: 2025-10-24T10:05:37.406683

**Executive Summary**

This intel report provides an overview of recent news developments in Indonesia, focusing on key policy changes, human rights concerns, and social issues that may impact businesses and expatriates. The analysis highlights the government's proposed national hero status for former President Soeharto, growing militarism, and lenient sentences under the Military Tribunal Law. These events demonstrate a shift towards authoritarianism and increased military involvement in civilian affairs.

**Key Points**

• Indonesia's government proposes national hero status for former President Soeharto, sparking human rights concerns.
• Growing militarism and lenient sentences under the Military Tribunal Law raise concerns about civilian safety and accountability.
• Students protest government policies and human rights abuses on the anniversary of President Prabowo Subianto's inauguration.
• Repatriation of British drug convicts is based on 'humanitarian' reasons, but actual motivations may be different.

**Impact Analysis**

The proposed national hero status for Soeharto has significant implications for businesses operating in Indonesia. It may lead to increased scrutiny and potential backlash from international partners and investors concerned about human rights abuses during his rule. Growing militarism and lenient sentences under the Military Tribunal Law may create a more restrictive business environment, as companies may face increased regulatory hurdles or even expropriation.

Expats in Indonesia should be aware of these developments, as they may impact their personal safety and well-being. The increased military presence in civilian affairs could lead to a more challenging living situation for expatriates, particularly those from countries critical of Indonesia's human rights record.

**Action Items**

• Businesses operating in Indonesia should closely monitor the government's actions on national hero status, militarism, and the Military Tribunal Law.
• Expats should stay informed about local conditions and consider adjusting their personal safety plans accordingly.
• Investors should reassess their exposure to Indonesia and consider diversifying their portfolios due to increased risks.

**Details**

The Jakarta Post reports that the Indonesian government has proposed national hero status for former President Soeharto, who ruled from 1966 until his ouster in 1998. This move is seen as a significant step towards revising history and whitewashing human rights abuses committed during his regime. Critics argue that awarding Soeharto this honor would be a betrayal of the victims' families and a slap in the face to those who fought for democracy.

The growing militarism and lenient sentences under the Military Tribunal Law are equally concerning, as they signal an erosion of civilian control over military affairs. This shift may lead to increased risks for businesses and expatriates, as the military becomes more involved in civilian life. The lenient treatment of human rights abuses by the Military Tribunal Law sends a chilling message that those responsible will face little accountability.

The repatriation of British drug convicts on 'humanitarian' grounds raises questions about the actual motivations behind this decision. Is it genuinely driven by concern for their well-being, or are there other factors at play? This move may be seen as a form of appeasement to foreign governments or an attempt to curry favor with international partners.

In conclusion, these recent developments in Indonesia demonstrate a concerning trend towards authoritarianism and increased military involvement in civilian affairs. Businesses and expats operating in the country should closely monitor these events and adjust their strategies accordingly to mitigate risks and ensure personal safety.

* The Indonesian government has revised its visa-free access policy to attract more foreign tourists.

This will involve significant investments in areas such as road development, airport expansion, and hotel construction.

The growth of foreign tourist arrivals is expected to continue, driven by a reduction in terrorist incidents and improvements in safety and security. However, this growth may also lead to increased pressure on local communities, including concerns around environmental sustainability and cultural preservation. Businesses operating in the tourism industry should prepare for increased demand by investing in infrastructure development and improving services.

The revised visa-free access policy is expected to attract more foreign tourists, but expats planning to visit or live in Indonesia should familiarize themselves with the new requirements and regulations. Local communities and stakeholders should engage with government agencies and private sector entities to ensure that tourism development is sustainable and responsible.

In terms of practical implications for businesses and expats in Indonesia, it is essential to note the following:

* Visa-free access policy was revised in 2015 to attract more foreign tourists

**Impact Analysis**

The growth of Indonesia's tourism industry has a significant impact on the country's economy, with each foreign visitor spending an average of $1,100-$1,200 per visit. This translates to substantial foreign exchange earnings and employment opportunities for Indonesians. The government's target to double the sector's contribution to GDP by 2019 will require increased investment in infrastructure, marketing campaigns, and visa-free access policy.

**Action Items**

* Businesses operating in Indonesia should consider investing in tourism-related infrastructure and services
* Expats and tourists planning to visit Indonesia should be aware of the revised visa-free access policy and plan accordingly
* The government should continue to improve its online promotional campaigns and visa-free access policy to attract more foreign tourists

**Details**

Indonesia's tourism industry has been growing steadily over the years, driven by improvements in infrastructure and a reduction in terrorist incidents. The country's unique culture, rich history, and natural beauty make it an attractive destination for tourists. However, the growth of the industry is not without challenges.

The government's target to double the sector's contribution to GDP by 2019 requires significant investment in infrastructure, marketing campaigns, and visa-free access policy. To achieve this target, the government will focus on improving accessibility, health and hygiene, online promotional campaigns, and visa-free access policy.

Improving accessibility is crucial for Indonesia's tourism industry. The country has a vast archipelago with many islands that are difficult to reach. Investing in infrastructure such as airports, seaports, and transportation systems will make it easier for tourists to travel within the country. Improving health and hygiene standards is also essential to ensure tourist safety.

Online promotional campaigns are critical to attract more foreign tourists. The government should invest in digital marketing strategies to promote Indonesia's tourism industry globally. Social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook can be used to showcase Indonesia's unique culture, rich history, and natural beauty.

The revised visa-free access policy is also an important initiative by the government to attract more foreign tourists. This policy allows tourists from eligible countries to enter Indonesia without a visa for up to 30 days. However, the policy has some limitations, such as restrictions on certain nationalities and types of visas.

In conclusion, Indonesia's tourism industry has significant potential for growth, driven by improvements in infrastructure and a reduction in terrorist incidents. The government's target to double the sector's contribution to GDP by 2019 requires significant investment in infrastructure, marketing campaigns, and visa-free access policy. Businesses operating in Indonesia should consider investing in tourism-related infrastructure and services, while expats and tourists planning to visit Indonesia should be aware of the revised visa-free access policy and plan accordingly.

Practical implications for businesses and expats in Indonesia include:

* Investing in tourism-related infrastructure and services
* Exploiting opportunities in the growing tourism industry
* Being aware of the revised visa-free access policy and planning accordingly
* Keeping up-to-date with government initiatives to improve accessibility, health and hygiene standards, online promotional campaigns, and visa-free access policy.
