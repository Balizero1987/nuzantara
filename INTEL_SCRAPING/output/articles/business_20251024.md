**Executive Summary**

Indonesia's business sector has been experiencing significant growth, driven by various initiatives and agreements between the government and international partners. The country is pushing to achieve its goal of 3 million houses through the Housing Program Credit (KPP), while also strengthening its presence in Southeast Asia through successful events in Bangkok. Additionally, Indonesia is positioning itself as a leader in the energy transition and climate-change mitigation efforts.

**Key Points**

* Indonesia's Ministry of Housing and Settlements expects KPP to accelerate the achievement of 3 million houses.
* Xsolla, a global video game commerce company, has strengthened its presence in Southeast Asia through successful events in Bangkok.
* Indonesia and Brazil have agreed to start RI-Mercosur CEPA negotiations soon.
* The Indonesian government is promoting the use of AI to drive efficiency and enhance industrial competitiveness.
* Indonesia's small-business export program, UMKM BISA Ekspor, generated USD108.82 million in transactions.

**Impact Analysis**

The growth of Indonesia's business sector will have a positive impact on the country's economy, creating new opportunities for businesses and expats alike. However, the government's focus on achieving 3 million houses through KPP may lead to increased competition for resources and potentially higher costs for businesses operating in the construction industry.

**Action Items**

* Businesses operating in Indonesia should take advantage of the growing market and invest in the country.
* Expats working in Indonesia should be aware of the opportunities and challenges presented by the government's initiatives, particularly those related to AI-driven structural reforms.
* The Indonesian government should ensure that its policies and regulations support the growth of small businesses and encourage foreign investment.

**Details**

Indonesia's business sector has been experiencing significant growth, driven by various initiatives and agreements between the government and international partners. The country is pushing to achieve its goal of 3 million houses through the Housing Program Credit (KPP), which is expected to accelerate the achievement of this goal. Xsolla, a global video game commerce company, has strengthened its presence in Southeast Asia through successful events in Bangkok, demonstrating Indonesia's potential as a hub for digital businesses.

The Indonesian government is also positioning itself as a leader in the energy transition and climate-change mitigation efforts. The country has agreed to start RI-Mercosur CEPA negotiations with Brazil, which will facilitate trade and investment between the two countries. Additionally, the government is promoting the use of AI to drive efficiency and enhance industrial competitiveness, which will benefit businesses operating in Indonesia.

However, the government's focus on achieving 3 million houses through KPP may lead to increased competition for resources and potentially higher costs for businesses operating in the construction industry. Moreover, the Indonesian government should ensure that its policies and regulations support the growth of small businesses and encourage foreign investment.

Practical implications for businesses and expats in Indonesia include:

* Businesses operating in Indonesia should take advantage of the growing market and invest in the country.
* Expats working in Indonesia should be aware of the opportunities and challenges presented by the government's initiatives, particularly those related to AI-driven structural reforms.
* The Indonesian government should ensure that its policies and regulations support the growth of small businesses and encourage foreign investment.

Overall, Indonesia's business sector is experiencing significant growth, driven by various initiatives and agreements between the government and international partners. While there are challenges to be addressed, the opportunities presented by the country's growing market make it an attractive destination for businesses and expats alike.

**Intel Report: BKPM Website Access Restriction**

### Executive Summary

The official website of the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board (BKPM) has been restricted, preventing users from accessing certain pages without login credentials. This development may impact businesses and expatriates relying on the website for investment information and services.

### Key Points

* The BKPM website has a 401 error message, indicating that access is restricted.
* Users are required to log in to an application to access certain pages.
* No specific reason or explanation is provided for the restriction.
* The website's URL remains active, but content is inaccessible without login credentials.

### Impact Analysis

The BKPM website is a critical resource for businesses and expatriates seeking investment information and services in Indonesia. The restricted access may affect:

* Investors: Unable to access relevant information on investment opportunities and procedures.
* Businesses: Struggling to navigate the complex regulatory landscape, potentially leading to delayed or abandoned investments.
* Expats: Finding it challenging to access necessary resources for setting up businesses or investing in Indonesia.

### Action Items

To mitigate the impact of this restriction:

* **BKPM**: Provide clear communication on the reason behind the restricted access and ensure that critical information is accessible to users without login credentials.
* **Businesses and Investors**: Consider alternative sources of information, such as consulting with local authorities or using other online platforms for investment-related services.
* **Expats**: Research alternative websites or resources offering similar services and invest in developing relationships with local partners or consultants familiar with the regulatory environment.

### Details

The BKPM website's restriction is likely due to security concerns or an attempt to centralize access through a specific application. However, this move may inadvertently create barriers for users seeking information on investment opportunities and procedures. The lack of clear communication from BKPM exacerbates the issue, leaving businesses and expatriates in a state of uncertainty.

In the context of Indonesia's business environment, this development highlights the need for:

* **Improved digital infrastructure**: Enhancing online services and accessibility to support businesses and investors.
* **Clear regulatory guidelines**: Providing transparent information on investment procedures and requirements to facilitate smoother operations.
* **Increased collaboration**: Encouraging partnerships between government agencies, businesses, and expatriate communities to address challenges and optimize opportunities in the Indonesian market.

This restriction serves as a reminder of the importance of adaptability and contingency planning for businesses operating in Indonesia. It is essential for stakeholders to stay informed about regulatory changes and be prepared to adjust their strategies accordingly.

**Comprehensive Business Intel Report**

**Executive Summary:**
The Indonesian government has adopted a mandatory B35 biodiesel program, which is expected to impact the country's palm oil industry. The move comes as CPO (Crude Palm Oil) prices have tumbled, affecting businesses and consumers alike. This report provides an analysis of the key points, impact on various stakeholders, and action items for businesses and expats in Indonesia.

**Key Points:**

* Mandatory B35 biodiesel program adopted by the Indonesian government
* CPO prices have plummeted, impacting palm oil industry
* Global chip crunch has stunted car sales recovery in Indonesia
* XL profit falls in Q3 due to tower sale income drying up

**Impact Analysis:**
The mandatory B35 biodiesel program is expected to have far-reaching consequences for various stakeholders in the Indonesian business sector. The impact will be felt by:

* **Palm oil industry:** The decline in CPO prices will likely lead to reduced revenue and profitability for palm oil producers, processors, and exporters.
* **Automotive sector:** The global chip crunch has already stunted car sales recovery in Indonesia, which may worsen with the mandatory B35 biodiesel program.
* **Energy sector:** The increased use of biodiesel is expected to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, but it also poses challenges for energy security and supply chain management.

**Action Items:**
Businesses and expats in Indonesia should consider the following:

* **Diversify revenue streams:** Palm oil producers and processors should explore alternative markets or products to mitigate the impact of declining CPO prices.
* **Invest in sustainable practices:** Companies operating in the palm oil industry must adopt sustainable practices to maintain social and environmental certification, ensuring continued market access.
* **Monitor energy sector developments:** Businesses reliant on fossil fuels should prepare for potential disruptions and invest in alternative energy sources or diversify their energy mix.

**Details:**
The Indonesian government's decision to adopt a mandatory B35 biodiesel program is part of efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and promote sustainable energy development. However, the move has sparked concerns among palm oil producers and processors, who are already reeling from declining CPO prices. The global chip crunch has added another layer of complexity to the Indonesian automotive sector, while XL's profit fall in Q3 highlights the challenges faced by businesses with exposure to tower sales.

In conclusion, the mandatory B35 biodiesel program is expected to have significant implications for various stakeholders in Indonesia. Businesses and expats should closely monitor developments in the energy sector and adjust their strategies accordingly to navigate these changes.

## Article 5: Indonesia's Financial & Capital Markets - Bonds, Stocks & Tax | Indonesia Investments {#article-5}

**Indonesia's Financial Markets: Opportunities and Challenges**

### Executive Summary

Indonesia's financial markets have shown steady growth, particularly in the bond market, which has expanded to offer a diverse range of debt instruments. The country's investment-grade status, achieved by all three major credit rating agencies, has boosted investor confidence. However, Indonesia's capital markets are shallow compared to other ASEAN countries and emerging markets, requiring improvement in banking sector development and financial literacy.

### Key Points

*   Indonesian bond market has grown significantly with a diverse array of debt instruments
*   Investment-grade status achieved by all three major credit rating agencies (Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investors Service, and Standards & Poor's)
*   Capital markets are shallow compared to other ASEAN countries and emerging markets
*   Limited banking sector development and financial literacy hinder market growth

### Impact Analysis

The expansion of Indonesia's bond market and investment-grade status have positive implications for investors, who can now invest in a more stable economy. However, the shallow capital markets pose challenges for businesses seeking funding or investing in the country.

**Who is affected:**

*   Investors looking to invest in Indonesia
*   Businesses seeking funding in Indonesia
*   Expats living and working in Indonesia

**How they are affected:**

*   Increased investment opportunities due to investment-grade status
*   Limited access to capital markets for businesses
*   Potential growth in financial literacy and banking sector development, benefiting expats and locals alike

### Action Items

To address the challenges of shallow capital markets:

1.  **Develop the banking sector**: Increase banking penetration and improve financial literacy among the population.
2.  **Deepen capital markets**: Encourage greater utilization of capital markets for financing investments and increase intermediation by non-bank financial institutions.
3.  **Improve financial infrastructure**: Enhance market liquidity, transparency, and regulatory frameworks to support market growth.

### Details

Indonesia's bond market has grown significantly, with a diverse array of debt instruments available. The central government is the largest issuer, selling conventional, retail, and Islamic bonds to both local and foreign investors. Bank Indonesia also issues Bank Indonesia Certificates (SBIs) for foreign investors. These instruments are traded over-the-counter rather than being listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

The country's investment-grade status has encouraged more capital inflows into Indonesia. Global funds can only invest in economies with this rating, which boosts investor confidence. However, Indonesia's capital markets are smaller and less liquid compared to other ASEAN countries and emerging markets.

Limited banking sector development and financial literacy hinder market growth. The World Bank data shows that less than 40% of Indonesia's adult population owns a bank account. This means there is ample room for growth in the country's banking sector.

To deepen capital markets, it is essential to develop the banking sector more rapidly. Improving financial literacy among the population and increasing banking penetration will help grow the market. The government can also support this by enhancing market liquidity, transparency, and regulatory frameworks.

In conclusion, Indonesia's financial markets offer opportunities for growth but require improvement in several areas. Developing the banking sector, deepening capital markets, and improving financial infrastructure are crucial steps to achieve sustainable growth.
