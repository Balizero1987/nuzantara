For example, Ekraf has launched a range of programs aimed at supporting startups and small businesses in the creative sector, from funding initiatives to mentorship schemes.\n\nAs a digital nomad, you may be wondering how you can get involved in these initiatives or support the growth of Indonesia's creative economy. The good news is that there are plenty of ways to do so – whether it's by attending events, investing in local businesses, or simply spreading the word about Bali's creative scene.\n\nSo, what does the future hold for Kemenpar and Ekraf?
