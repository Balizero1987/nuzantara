Spread over a thousand islands, there are literally thousands of years of history and culture to explore. Areas around the capital of [Jakarta](https://www.internations.org/jakarta-expats) especially are on the rise economically, but all over the country big investments are being made to extract and use all the country's resources. Areas such as Papua and other oil- and gas-rich islands are seeing more job opportunities for expats, but most jobs are still in the Jakarta area. There‚Äôs a lot to see and do in Indonesia for all types of people, from ancient temples to modern, upscale clubs and restaurants in the bigger cities. This can all be overwhelming at first, so let InterNations take the heat off you and guide you through. So whether you want to know the best local bars and clubs, schools, or even find a job, InterNations is the service you need.\nInterNations is the largest global network for expatriates, with communities in 420 cities around the world. Meet fellow global minds in your city of residence or get to know local expatriates before you're moving or traveling abroad and never feel like a stranger. InterNations makes it easy for you to stay in touch with your expat friends, both online and offline, so you can grow your network of friends and contacts from all over the world. Whether they live in [Portugal](https://www.internations.org/portugal-expats) or [Peru](https://www.internations.org/peru-expats), InterNations allows you to be close to them even if they are miles away.\n## The International Community for Expats in Indonesia\nIndonesian society can be a real culture shock to many expats, as life here can be chaotic and temperamental. But hey, at least it‚Äôs exciting! Indonesian roads are legendarily hard to navigate for foreigners, and many expats consider having a local driver as an essential service. If you‚Äôre finding local life difficult to adjust to at first, don‚Äôt worry; you‚Äôre not alone! Join InterNations today and you can instantly be in contact with like-minded fellow expats, who can give you a taste of home while living in a foreign land. InterNations' communities in Indonesia offer a huge range of activities and social events at which to meet and hopefully make friends with fellow expats ‚Äî from trekking and exploring in Indonesia‚Äôs plentiful jungles to cocktail nights in [Jakarta](https://www.internations.org/jakarta-expats) and casual socials, there is sure to be something for you upon joining our friendly and welcoming InterNations community.\n  * **Henrik Olsen**\nI was amazed how many other members in Jakarta share the same interests as me. And some of them come from Norway, too ! \n  * **Megan Turner**\nIt's a really helpful site: Via InterNations, we found an international playgroup for our kids (6 and 8 years old) here in Jakarta.\n\n\n## Our Global Partners\n## Communities in Indonesia\n[Expats in Jakarta](https://www.internations.org/jakarta-expats)\n[Expats in Bali](https://www.internations.org/bali-expats)\n[Expats
