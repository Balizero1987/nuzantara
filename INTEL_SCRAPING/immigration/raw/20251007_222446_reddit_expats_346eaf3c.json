Please excuse me if I come across a bit rough in my writing. I arrived in France in 2015 to follow my French wife from Korea. As someone who didn‚Äôt know what life as a foreigner was like, I‚Äôve come to realize how much I took the good things in my life for granted before. We pay 1,510 euros a month in rent for a 70m¬≤ place. But I can‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs not enough to live safely. Once I got a job here, I started taking the subway, but I couldn‚Äôt stand seeing shit in the station. When I had to take it late at night because of overtime, I even saw drug users. That‚Äôs why I bought a car. Driving made life bearable. But one day, someone smashed one of my side mirrors and ran off. I installed a dashcam like Koreans do to prepare for that kind of crap. A few months later, a thief broke my car window and stole the dashcam. And the car was parked in an underground parking lot, not outside. Plus, I don‚Äôt live in one of those so-called ‚Äúzones‚Äù in French that are considered dangerous or some shithole. Why would I pay 1,510 euros for that? That motherfucker was caught a year later, and I was kind of surprised that the police in France could even catch a petty criminal like that. And yesterday, I was about to go through a green light when a guy in a tracksuit ignored the red pedestrian signal. I slammed on the brakes, but I didn‚Äôt honk‚ÄîI just grimaced and raised my hands. Then this guy yelled some ‚Äúching chang‚Äù crap at me and threw a water bottle at my car. My friend said I was stupid for making that gesture. But what should I have done? Should I have just smiled dumbly and waved? South Koreans work too much, drink a lot, materialism, plastic surgery‚Äîwhatever you say. For me, big cities in France feel like horror movies. As I love my wife and son, I accept that I can‚Äôt go back to Korea. I read a comment that said: ‚ÄúYeah, there‚Äôs differences between countries but ‚Äòliterally afraid to go outside alone‚Äô in Germany or France probably just means you were too poor to live in a good area and you don‚Äôt have that problem in Asia.‚Äù Yeah, I‚Äôm not rich. But so what? At least I think I pay enough to live safely. How much more do I need to pay for a safe place? 2,000? 3,000? I doubt it‚Äôs worth it‚Ä¶  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1o0c23q/i_disagree_with_the_idea_that_people_talking/)\n* * *\n[ ![avatar di u/OpenAI](https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_bjljw0/styles/profileIcon_x9h0braqsqqf1.png?width=48&height=48&frame=1&auto=webp&crop=48%3A48%2Csmart&s=e2846c1c9fc9c34cff707cd34840d11651c18cbe) u/OpenAI ](https://www.reddit.com/user/OpenAI/) ‚Ä¢  [ Ufficiale ](https://www.reddit.com/user/OpenAI/) ‚Ä¢ Promozione\nTurn ideas into images with ChatGPT.

But it seems that everything is a \"terrorist group\" lately.  There's also a paragraph that says that to return someone to the U.S., a passport that only grants travel back to the U.S. can be issued, or a limited passport.  If this bill comes to pass, how could this affect us ex-pats? Can they invalidate our passports remotely? It's a bit worrying.  It's on page 43 and 44 of the bill. There's a pdf online but I can't post links or photos on this sub.  Edit: as someone pointed out, section 226 has been revoked from the proposed bill!  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1nme4ot/introduced_bill_to_revoke_passports_and/)\n* * *\n[ Return to UK?

How? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/expats/comments/1o0955p/return_to_uk_how/) [ Hello! 10 years ago I left the UK after living there for almost 4 years. Since then I traveled around Europe (I am EU and US citizen) but I never felt as at home as I did back in the UK. There is this longing that grows the more I try to find another place to settle. Due to the Brexit it‚Äôs almost impossible to return- also I don‚Äôt work in an industry that easily issues sponsorships (marketing). Also I‚Äôm not really working in that field anymore, I hold degrees and work experience but that‚Äôs kind of the past.  Everytime I try to find a new place or exciting perspective it takes max 6 weeks until this longing comes back. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just nostalgia ‚Ä¶ because I tried to settle elsewhere and I never felt the same degree of belonging.  Any advice or similar experiences?
