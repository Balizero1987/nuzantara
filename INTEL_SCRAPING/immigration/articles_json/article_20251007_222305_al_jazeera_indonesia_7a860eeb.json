  "title": "# School Collapse in Indonesia Claims Lives of at Least 61 Children  The usually serene streets of Puncak, a suburb of Bogor, were yesterday transformed into a scene of utter devastation as news spread like wildfire that the search for victims from the al-Khoziny Islamic boarding school had been called off. The death toll, finalized after an extensive and arduous search operation, stands at a heartbreaking 61 lives lost.  This tragedy serves as a stark reminder of the risks that expats and digital nomads face when living abroad, particularly in countries with less stringent building codes and regulatory oversight. While Indonesia is known for its stunning natural beauty and welcoming culture, incidents like this one underscore the importance of conducting thorough research before making long-term plans to relocate.  For those considering calling Bali home, this incident highlights the need to prioritize safety above all else. It is crucial to note that the collapsed school had been deemed safe by local authorities before it met its tragic end. This unfortunate event serves as a stark warning for anyone considering moving to Indonesia or other countries with similar regulatory challenges.  The al-Khoziny Islamic boarding school, which was built in 2016 and had a capacity of over 1,000 students, succumbed to structural failure after heavy rainfall hit the area on December 11. The collapse left many young lives forever changed.  In light of this tragedy, we urge all expats and digital nomads living in Bali to familiarize themselves with local safety protocols and building codes. Understanding these regulations can help prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. We also encourage those considering moving to Indonesia to engage with local authorities and community leaders to better understand their concerns and priorities.  While it is impossible to predict such tragedies, being informed and proactive are key to minimizing risks. As we move forward, it's essential that we prioritize the safety of all members of our communities, both local and international.  Moving forward, Bali continues to be a haven for expats and digital nomads looking for an affordable and culturally rich lifestyle. With its stunning landscapes and welcoming culture, the island offers endless opportunities for personal growth and professional development.  In conclusion, while this incident brings sadness to all who know it, we can take away valuable lessons on prioritizing safety above all else and engaging with local authorities to better understand their concerns and priorities. As Bali continues to grow in popularity as a hub for expats and digital nomads, it is essential that we prioritize the well-being of our communities.  **Takeaway:** Always conduct thorough research before making long-term plans to relocate to a new country, especially when it comes to safety and regulatory protocols.",
