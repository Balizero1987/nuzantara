**Understanding the Visa Requirements: A Simplified Overview**

Bali is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Indonesia, attracting millions of visitors every year. For those planning to live or work in Bali long-term, understanding the visa requirements is essential.

There are two main types of visas for foreigners living in Indonesia:

1.  **Social Visa**: Also known as a "visit" visa, this type of visa allows you to stay in Indonesia for up to six months from the date of entry.
2.  **Work Visa** (also known as a "karta kerja" or "KTP karya"): This visa is issued to foreigners who have been employed by an Indonesian company and are living in Indonesia on a work permit.

To obtain a Social Visa, you'll need to meet certain requirements, including:

*   Holding a valid passport with at least six months' validity
*   Having sufficient funds for your stay (approximately $500-$1,000)
*   A completed application form
*   Recent photographs
*   Proof of onward travel

On the other hand, obtaining a Work Visa requires more extensive documentation, including:

*   A valid passport with at least six months' validity
*   A job offer from an Indonesian company
*   A bachelor's degree or higher (depending on the type of work visa)
*   A medical certificate
*   A police certificate

**Key Takeaways:**

*   The Social Visa is suitable for tourists and short-term visitors.
