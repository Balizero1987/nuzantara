But have you heard about Indonesia's new visa policy that's set to revolutionize the way you live and work in Bali?  In December 2022, the Indonesian government announced a major overhaul of its visa policies, aimed at attracting more foreign workers and entrepreneurs to the country. And for many expats and digital nomads, this news is music to their ears.  So, what does the new policy entail? In short, it's designed to make it easier and more affordable for foreigners to live and work in Indonesia. Here are some key points to know:  ## **Simplified Visa Process**  One of the most significant changes is a simplified visa process that allows digital nomads to apply for a **Limited Stay Visa (LSV)** online. This new type of visa is designed specifically for remote workers and can be applied for from outside Indonesia, making it much easier to get started.  ## **No Language Requirement**  Another major win is the removal of language requirements for many types of visas. No longer will you need to demonstrate fluency in Indonesian or English – simply meeting certain income and health requirements will do.  ## **Increased Work Hours**  The new policy also allows digital nomads to work more hours than previously allowed, with some types of visas permitting up to 8 hours of work per day. This is a major boost for those looking to build a sustainable online business or career.  ## **Tax Breaks and Incentives**  And for entrepreneurs and small business owners, the new policy offers tax breaks and incentives that can help reduce your tax liability in Indonesia. We'll dive deeper into these details later.  ## **What's Next?**  So what does this mean for you as an expat or digital nomad in Bali? Well, it means you have more options than ever when it comes to securing a visa and starting your life in Indonesia. Whether you're looking to apply for a Limited Stay Visa or explore other types of visas, the new policy offers many benefits.  ## **Practical Takeaway**  Before applying for a new visa under this policy, make sure you meet all the eligibility requirements and have all necessary documents ready. You can find more information on the Indonesian government's official website or by consulting with a local immigration expert. Don't let paperwork hold you back – get started today!",
