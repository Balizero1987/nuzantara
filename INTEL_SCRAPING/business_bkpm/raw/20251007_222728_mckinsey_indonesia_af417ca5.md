Impact on Society
![Indonesia Social Impact](https://www.mckinsey.com/id/~/media/mckinsey/locations/asia/indonesia/overview/indonesia_overview_social-imapact_shuhaela-2_1536x864.jpg?cq=50&mw=767&cpy=Center)
Indonesia Social Impact
We are committed to contributing meaningfully to the country and the community.
One key priority is the development of future leaders. We founded [Young Leaders for Indonesia Foundation](http://yli.or.id/) (YLI) in 2008, focused on 3rd and 4th year university students who will be Indonesia’s next-generation leaders. The YLI Foundation is supported by several partners including major companies in Indonesia. It has developed hundreds of Indonesian students from leading universities—and is now expanding the reach across 25 universities nationwide and overseas.
When crisis strikes, we play our part in helping public and social institutions respond. In the aftermath of the 2004 earthquake in Aceh, we contributed our management expertise to improve the impact of recovery measures—and strengthen Indonesia’s future resilience, by supporting the government of Indonesia through the establishment of Badan Rehabilitasi dan Rekonstruksi (BRR), a special agency formed by the President focusing on disaster management.
