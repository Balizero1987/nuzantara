Recently, satellite images revealed that the Indonesia-Korea Infrastructure (IKN) project has an extremely limited water area of only 0.51 percent. This raises concerns about the sustainability of this ambitious infrastructure development.\n\n**Body:**\n### **Understanding IKN Expansion**\n\nThe IKN project is a significant infrastructure development aimed at strengthening Indonesia's economy and improving living standards. However, its expansion has raised eyebrows among environmentalists and locals who are concerned about the impact on water management in the region.\n\nThe limited water area of 0.51 percent raises questions about the long-term sustainability of this project. It is essential to note that water management is a critical aspect of any infrastructure development, as it directly affects the environment and the local community.\n\n### **Environmental Implications**\n\nThe lack of adequate water management in IKN expansion poses significant environmental risks. Insufficient water supply can lead to droughts, which can have devastating effects on local ecosystems and wildlife habitats. Moreover, inadequate waste management can contaminate water sources, further exacerbating the problem.\n\n### **Practical Implications for Businesses and Tourists**\n\nFor businesses operating in Bali, understanding the implications of IKN expansion is crucial. The limited water area may impact the region's ability to support large-scale industrial development, which could have significant effects on local employment rates and economic growth.\n\nTourists visiting Bali should be aware that inadequate water management can affect the overall tourist experience. Droughts and water scarcity can lead to reduced access to clean water, affecting the quality of hotels, resorts, and other tourist facilities.\n\n### **What This Means for You**\n\nAs an expat or business operating in Bali, it is essential to stay informed about IKN expansion and its implications. We recommend:\n\n*   Staying up-to-date with local news and developments related to IKN\n*   Consulting with experts on water management and environmental sustainability\n*   Considering the potential impact of IKN expansion on your operations\n\n### **Action Items**\n\nIf you are a business operating in Bali, consider the following steps:\n\n1.  Conduct thorough research on the implications of IKN expansion for your industry\n2.  Develop contingency plans to address potential water management issues\n3.  Engage with local stakeholders and experts to ensure that your operations align with sustainable practices\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAs Indonesia continues to expand its infrastructure development, it is crucial for expats and businesses operating in Bali to stay informed about the implications of IKN expansion. By understanding the environmental and practical implications of this project, we can work together to promote sustainable practices and mitigate potential risks.\n\n**Metadata:**\n\n*   Target audience: tourists, expats, investors, businesses\n*   Urgency level: immediate\n*   Impact level: high",
