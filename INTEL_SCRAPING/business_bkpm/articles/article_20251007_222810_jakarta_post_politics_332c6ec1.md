**Title:** Indonesia's IKN Expansion Raises Concerns for Water Management and Environmental Sustainability

**Lead:** As Indonesia continues to expand its infrastructure development, concerns are growing over the impact on water management and environmental sustainability in the region.

**Introduction:**
For expats and businesses operating in Bali, understanding the local politics and infrastructure developments is crucial for staying informed about potential changes that may affect their operations. Recently, satellite images revealed that the Indonesia-Korea Infrastructure (IKN) project has an extremely limited water area of only 0.51 percent. This raises concerns about the sustainability of this ambitious infrastructure development.

**Body:**
### **Understanding IKN Expansion**

The IKN project is a significant infrastructure development aimed at strengthening Indonesia's economy and improving living standards. However, its expansion has raised eyebrows among environmentalists and locals who are concerned about the impact on water management in the region.

The limited water area of 0.51 percent raises questions about the long-term sustainability of this project. It is essential to note that water management is a critical aspect of any infrastructure development, as it directly affects the environment and the local community.

### **Environmental Implications**

The lack of adequate water management in IKN expansion poses significant environmental risks. Insufficient water supply can lead to droughts, which can have devastating effects on local ecosystems and wildlife habitats. Moreover, inadequate waste management can contaminate water sources, further exacerbating the problem.

### **Practical Implications for Businesses and Tourists**

For businesses operating in Bali, understanding the implications of IKN expansion is crucial. The limited water area may impact the region's ability to support large-scale industrial development, which could have significant effects on local employment rates and economic growth.

Tourists visiting Bali should be aware that inadequate water management can affect the overall tourist experience. Droughts and water scarcity can lead to reduced access to clean water, affecting the quality of hotels, resorts, and other tourist facilities.
