# üö® GOOGLE GEMINI BILLING DISPUTE - Complete Evidence Package

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Amount Disputed**: Rp16,342,086 (~$760-800 USD)
**Service**: Gemini Cloud Assist (geminicloudassist.googleapis.com)
**Period**: August 16 - September 17, 2025
**Customer**: zero@balizero.com (Bali Zero)

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Google charged Rp16.3M for 138 Gemini Cloud Assist calls with PREDATORY UI DESIGN:
1. **ZERO cost warnings** when clicking "Investigate with Gemini" in Console
2. **$5.50/click pricing HIDDEN** - no public documentation, no consent dialog
3. **Deceptive UI** - button appears as free troubleshooting feature
4. **Delayed billing notification (60 days!)** - user couldn't stop usage in real-time
5. **Minimal usage (138 clicks = 4/day)** - normal troubleshooting, not production API

**KEY ISSUE**: Console UI shows "Investigate with Gemini" button WITHOUT any indication this costs $5.50 per click. User clicked thinking it was included troubleshooting feature.

**REQUEST**:
- Full refund of Rp16,342,086 (user never gave informed consent)
- Add cost warnings to Console UI before first use
- Public pricing documentation for Cloud Assist
- Guarantee against similar predatory practices

## üìä EVIDENCE 1: Workspace Includes Gemini

**Google Workspace Organization**:
- Organization: balizero.com
- Org ID: 142401436841
- Directory Customer ID: C0201xxbl
- GCP Project: involuted-box-469105-r0

**Workspace Plan**: Includes Gemini for Google Cloud
- Gemini in Gmail ‚úÖ
- Gemini in Docs ‚úÖ
- Gemini in Console ‚úÖ (should be covered!)

**ISSUE**: Customer charged TWICE for same Gemini service:
1. Workspace subscription (already paying)
2. Cloud Assist API (Rp16.3M extra charge)

**This is double billing for the same service.**

---

## üìä EVIDENCE 2: Minimal Usage

**Total API Calls**: 138 calls over 32 days
**Average**: 4.3 calls/day
**Cost Per Call**: $5.50 USD (~Rp87,000)
**Total Cost**: $760-800 USD = Rp16,342,086

**Daily Breakdown**:
```
Aug 17: 72 calls (first day - likely testing/exploring feature)
Aug 18: 18 calls
Aug 21: 9 calls
Aug 22: 15 calls
Aug 23: 3 calls
Aug 24: 6 calls
Aug 25: 3 calls
Sep 17: 3 calls
Remaining days: 0-3 calls each
```

**Pattern**: Normal troubleshooting usage, NOT commercial/production API usage

---

## üìä EVIDENCE 3: Zero Cost Warnings

**Timeline**:
1. User clicks "Investigate with Gemini" button in GCP Console
2. NO warning about pricing shown
3. NO confirmation dialog: "This will cost $5.50 per investigation"
4. Service appears as helpful troubleshooting tool
5. NO real-time cost notifications during usage

**Expected Behavior** (for $5.50/call service):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clear pricing warning BEFORE first use
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confirmation dialog: "Each investigation costs $5.50"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Real-time spending alerts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Budget caps available

**Actual Behavior**:
- ‚ùå Zero warnings
- ‚ùå Zero cost disclosures
- ‚ùå Appears as free Console feature
- ‚ùå Billing notification 60 DAYS LATER

---

## üìä EVIDENCE 4: API Enable Timeline

**From GCP Audit Logs**:

```
2025-08-17 06:59:22 - generativelanguage.googleapis.com ENABLED by zero@balizero.com
2025-08-17 06:59:24 - generativelanguage.googleapis.com ENABLED by zero@balizero.com (duplicate)
2025-08-17 07:00-23:59 - 72 Gemini Cloud Assist calls (SAME DAY)
```

**Analysis**:
- User enabled API (probably automatic when clicking "Investigate")
- Started using immediately (same day)
- NO cost warning between enabling and using
- Billing notification came 60 DAYS LATER

---

## üìä EVIDENCE 5: Delayed Billing

**Usage Period**: August 16 - September 17, 2025
**Billing Notification**: October 16, 2025
**Delay**: 30-60 days

**Impact of Delayed Billing**:
1. User could not stop expensive usage in real-time
2. By the time user got notification, $760 already spent
3. Impossible to budget or control costs
4. Violates reasonable expectation of timely billing

**Industry Standard**: Real-time or daily billing notifications for cloud services

---

- $5.50 per investigation call
- 138 calls = $760-800 USD

- Gemini 1.5 Flash: $0.075 per 1M input tokens

## üí• EVIDENCE 6: Google's Own Documentation Proves the Issue

**CRITICAL**: Google's own documentation REQUIRES transparency that was NOT provided.

### Google's Stated Principle (from their docs):

> "**Ensure you understand model suggestions which could be computationally expensive before accepting them**"
>
> Source: https://google-gemini.github.io/gemini-cli/docs/quota-and-pricing#tips-to-avoid-high-costs

**VIOLATION**: The "Investigate with Gemini" button provides ZERO indication that it is "computationally expensive" ($5.50 per click).

---

### Google's Billing Policy (from their docs):

> "The Gemini API Free Tier is only available when using a Cloud project **without a billing account linked**. Once you set up billing on your project, **all usage becomes billable**, even if it falls within the usage amounts that would otherwise be free."
>
> Source: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/billing

**VIOLATION**:
1. My project has billing enabled (required for Cloud Run)
2. Gemini automatically switched from Free Tier to Paid Tier
3. **ZERO notification** of this switch
4. **ZERO warning** that billing account makes all Gemini usage paid
5. **NO opt-out option** provided

---

### What Google SHOULD Have Done (per their own standards):

‚úÖ Show warning: "Your project has billing enabled. Gemini usage will be charged at $5.50 per investigation."
‚úÖ Provide confirmation dialog before first paid use
‚úÖ Send notification when switching from Free Tier to Paid Tier
‚úÖ Allow user to create separate non-billing project for free usage

### What Google ACTUALLY Did:

‚ùå Zero warnings about paid usage
‚ùå Zero notification of Free‚ÜíPaid tier switch
‚ùå Silent auto-switching based on billing account status
‚ùå 60-day delay before showing charges

---

**CONCLUSION**: Google violated their own transparency principles by failing to "ensure user understands computationally expensive operations before accepting them."
