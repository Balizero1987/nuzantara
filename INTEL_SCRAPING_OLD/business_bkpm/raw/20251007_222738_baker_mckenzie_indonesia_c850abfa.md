#### Banking and Finance
We cover the complete spectrum of financial products, from the plain vanilla to the most sophisticated products, e.g., bilateral and syndicated loans, structured and project finance, acquisition finance, medium term notes and other fixed income debts up to Islamic finance, fintech, derivatives and securitization.
#### Capital Markets
We provide companies, underwriters, financial institutions and investment banks with a wide range of all capital markets/securities related matters, including offering (both debt and equity), corporate counseling, corporate governance and compliance/ regulatory matters. We regularly assist in public company M&A, joint ventures, reorganizations and in the establishment of securities companies and venture capital companies. We have established relationships with regulatory agencies in the Indonesian capital market, providing advice during law-making processes.
#### Customs
We assist clients in structuring business models and agreements for the manufacture, supply, sale and movement of goods and services, both domestically and internationally. Our main objective is to advise or assist clients to overcome their supply chain or commercial difficulties relating to all aspects of customs and international trade, including market-entry requirements (general and specific import restrictions or prohibitions), export controls and sanctions, supply chain structuring models, customs valuations, import export duties and preferential tariff issues, tariff classifications, customs benefits, e.g., waiver of duties, customs audits, customs objections and customs appeals, local content and contractual matters (such as advising on provisions in agreements to minimize implications from customs and trade aspects).
#### Dispute Resolution
Our dispute lawyers handle complex, cross-border, multijurisdictional cases and provide advocacy services for civil and commercial dispute/litigation matters before Indonesian courts, including international and domestic arbitration, commercial litigation, general dispute, compliance, anticorruption /anti-bribery, administrative law, and debt restructuring/insolvency.
#### Employment
We are a full service employment practice and assist employers with the full range of work end-to-end from “hire to fire”. In contrast to other firms, we field specialist practitioners with experience in both employment litigation and non-contentious employment advisory matters.
#### Energy, Mining and Infrastructure
We have advised investors, developers and lenders in a number of Indonesia’s landmark transactions in the energy, mining and infrastructure sectors. In the power sector, our work covers the full spectrum of the fuel mix – from fossil-fuel power generation projects through to renewable energies such as solar and hydro. Our mining practice covers coal and industrial and precious metals. Our oil and gas expertise covers the full value chain – from upstream M&A to development of pipelines and LNG facilities, and downstream trading. We are at the forefront of Indonesia’s social and transport infrastructure, advising government and private investors on rail, toll road, seaport and water projects.
#### Financial Services
We assist clients in the establishment, setup and structuring of business operation; structuring, development and marketing of wholesale and retail financial products; and corporate governance and documentation; and we also provide support in contentious matters.
#### Intellectual Property
Our IP team assist foreign and Indonesian companies in obtaining protection for trademarks, copyrights, patents, industrial designs, trade secrets, plant varieties and domain names. We offer a full range of services in both noncontentious and contentious matters, and help manage various well-known trademark and patent portfolios. We assist in the exploitation of rights through licensing, franchising and commercial related IP agreements. Investigations of potential infringers, and carrying out cease and desist campaigns, anti counterfeiting raids and IP litigation have become a significant part of our services to international clients seeking to protect and enforce their IP rights in Indonesia’s difficult enforcement environment.
#### M&A
We provide transactional and nontransactional support on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, foreign direct investment, reorganizations, spin-offs, strategic alliances and compliance/regulator matters. We advise all types of corporate and commercial business law matters - regardless of size, complexity or location - from start to completion. Collaborating with senior foreign legal consultants and colleagues in other disciplines, we tailor our solution to relevant legal, regulator and tax requirements. Our focus practices are private equity/Venture Capital for acquisitions and investment, insurance, Technology, Media and Telecommunications, Healthcare & Life Sciences and Plantation/forestry.
#### Real Estate
We advise on the Indonesian legal aspects of every stage of asset acquisitions and disposals, construction and development, hotel resort and tourism, leasing, property management, real estate M&A, real estate financing and REITs.
#### Tax
Our team of tax lawyers advise Indonesian and foreign companies on structuring tax-efficient arrangements for domestic and international transactions, including transfer pricing matters.
