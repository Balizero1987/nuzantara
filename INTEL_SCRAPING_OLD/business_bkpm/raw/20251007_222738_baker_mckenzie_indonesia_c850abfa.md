#### Dispute Resolution
Our dispute lawyers handle complex, cross-border, multijurisdictional cases and provide advocacy services for civil and commercial dispute/litigation matters before Indonesian courts, including international and domestic arbitration, commercial litigation, general dispute, compliance, anticorruption /anti-bribery, administrative law, and debt restructuring/insolvency.

Our mining practice covers coal and industrial and precious metals. Our oil and gas expertise covers the full value chain â from upstream M&A to development of pipelines and LNG facilities, and downstream trading. We are at the forefront of Indonesiaâs social and transport infrastructure, advising government and private investors on rail, toll road, seaport and water projects.

Our IP team assist foreign and Indonesian companies in obtaining protection for trademarks, copyrights, patents, industrial designs, trade secrets, plant varieties and domain names. We offer a full range of services in both noncontentious and contentious matters, and help manage various well-known trademark and patent portfolios. We assist in the exploitation of rights through licensing, franchising and commercial related IP agreements. Investigations of potential infringers, and carrying out cease and desist campaigns, anti counterfeiting raids and IP litigation have become a significant part of our services to international clients seeking to protect and enforce their IP rights in Indonesiaâs difficult enforcement environment.

We provide transactional and nontransactional support on mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, foreign direct investment, reorganizations, spin-offs, strategic alliances and compliance/regulator matters. We advise all types of corporate and commercial business law matters - regardless of size, complexity or location - from start to completion.

The Alumni Community provides a way for us to stay connected with former colleagues who have gone on to new challenges, whether they be in-house, with other law firms, or out of law completely. We value the opportunity to continue our relationship with you and keep you up to date on exclusive alumni events, networking opportunities and firm updates via our bi-annual Alumni Newsletter.
If you wish to join our Alumni Community, please register below. Feel free to extend the invite to alumni you are in contact with.
**We want to hear from you**. If you have any questions you would like to ask, recently moved, suggestions for content to share with the wider network, or anything or anyone you would like to profile in our newsletters, we would be very keen to hear about it, please write to us at HHPalumni@hhplawfirm.com.
